<p>The <code>HandleParams</code> module is designed to render and manage a page that displays country details based on URL parameters. Here's a breakdown:</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>It initializes the LiveView with the list of countries in the "Baltic Countries" region by invoking <code>Countries.list_region_country/1</code>. The result is stored in the socket's assigns under the key <code>:countries</code>. This function runs once when the LiveView is mounted.</p>
<h3><code>handle_params/3</code></h3>
<p>This function is triggered whenever there's a navigation event that changes the URL parameters. It has two clauses:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The first clause handles a URL parameter with the key <code>id</code>. It attempts to fetch the details of the country with the given ID using <code>Countries.get_country!/1</code>. If the country exists, it assigns it to <code>:selected_country</code>. If the fetch fails (i.e., the country ID is not found), it sets <code>:selected_country</code> to <code>nil</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The second clause serves as a fallback for when there are no URL parameters. It checks if there are any countries in the <code>:countries</code> assign. If not, it sets <code>:selected_country</code> to <code>nil</code>. If there are countries, it sets <code>:selected_country</code> to the first country in the list (<code>hd(countries)</code>).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>The render function generates the HTML content using a HEEx template. It conditionally renders tabs for each country if there are any countries available. Each tab has a link with URL parameters corresponding to the country ID. It determines which tab is active based on whether the country is the selected country. It then calls <code>country_details/1</code> to render the details of the selected country.</p>
<h3><code>country_details/1</code></h3>
<p>This helper function has three clauses, each generating different HEEx content based on the assigns:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>If there are no countries in the <code>:countries</code> assign, it renders an alert indicating no countries were found in the specified region.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If <code>:selected_country</code> is <code>nil</code>, it renders an alert that no country was found for the provided ID.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If there is a selected country, it renders a list of country details, including the country's code, continent, region, year of independence, government form, head of state, population (formatted with delimiters for readability), GNP, and life expectancy.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
