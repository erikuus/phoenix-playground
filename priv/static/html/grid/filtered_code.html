<p>
  The
  <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.GridLive.Filtered.Index</code> demonstrates how to
  coordinate pagination, sorting, and filtering functionality in a LiveView
  module using functional helper modules.
</p>

<p>
  The key insight is that these helpers must work together in a specific
  sequence because filtering affects record counts, which pagination needs for
  calculating valid page ranges.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>FilteringHelpers</strong>: Processes search criteria with type
    conversion and validation
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SortingHelpers</strong>: Manages column sorting with direction
    indicators
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PaginationHelpers</strong>: Controls page navigation with dynamic
    page calculations
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  The mount function follows a carefully orchestrated sequence that handles the
  interdependencies between filtering, sorting, and pagination.
</p>

<h4>Context Configuration</h4>
<p>
  Each helper requires its configuration before processing parameters. The
  filtering context is the most complex because it defines field-specific types,
  defaults, and validation rules. For detailed information about each helper's
  context structure, see the individual helper explanations.
</p>

<h4>Parameter Processing Pipeline</h4>
<p>
  The mount function processes URL parameters through a carefully orchestrated
  sequence that handles the interdependencies between filtering, sorting, and
  pagination. The key challenge is that we cannot use a single pipeline for both
  conversion and validation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Why conversion can use one pipeline:</strong> Each helper converts
    only parameters relevant to its domain, then passes the parameters to the
    next helper. Since conversion doesn't require interdependent data, all three
    helpers can process sequentially in a single pipeline.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Why validation requires breaking the pipeline:</strong> Pagination
    validation needs an accurate record count based on valid filter options.
    This means we cannot validate pagination until filtering is completely
    validated and the database count is recalculated with the new filter
    criteria.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The critical comparison <code>if options != valid_options do</code> detects
  any differences between original converted parameters and final validated
  ones. When differences exist, <code>push_navigate</code> redirects to the
  corrected URL, ensuring users see clean, valid URLs that reflect the actual
  application state.
</p>

<h4>Initialization Sequence</h4>
<p>
  When no URL correction is needed, the mount function initializes all helper
  assigns and loads data:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Each helper's <code>init_*</code> function returns assigns in a consistent
    tuple format
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>FilteredLanguages.list_languages/1</code> receives the final validated
    options
  </li>
  <li>
    The stream is populated with initial data matching all current parameters
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>apply_action/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles different LiveView routes and clears previous state appropriately. For
  the index action, it calls <code>apply_options/3</code> to process URL
  parameters and determine if data needs reloading.
</p>

<h3><code>apply_options/3</code></h3>
<p>
  The core purpose of <code>apply_options/3</code> is to determine if filter,
  sorting, or pagination options have changed due to user UI interactions, and
  whether the data stream needs to be reset accordingly. It answers the
  question: "Has something changed that requires fetching fresh data from the
  database?"
</p>

<p>The function is called in these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    User changes filter criteria (typing in search boxes, selecting dropdown
    values)
  </li>
  <li>User clicks column headers to change sorting</li>
  <li>User clicks pagination controls to change pages or items per page</li>
  <li>
    User returns from create/edit modal where options haven't changed but data
    might have
  </li>
  <li>
    User clicks a "reset" link to force data reload after background updates
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How It Works: Sequential Helper Resolution</h4>
<p>
  It calls each helper's <code>resolve_*_changes</code> function one by one.
  Each helper examines its domain-specific parameters and returns either
  <code>{:reset_stream, valid_options}</code> if changes require data reloading,
  or <code>{:noreset_stream, valid_options}</code> if no reload is needed.
  Here's the key insight: only one helper detects changes in any single user
  interaction as users cannot change filtering, sorting, and pagination
  simultaneously.
</p>

<h4>The Clever Use of force_reset</h4>
<p>
  The <code>force_reset</code> parameter has two distinct purposes in this
  function:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>User-Initiated Reset</strong>: When users click "reload and sort
    now" links (displayed in flash messages after create, edit, or delete
    operations), <code>force_reset</code> is set to <code>true</code>. This
    overrides all helper logic and forces a complete data reload regardless of
    parameter changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cascading Reset Logic</strong>: When one helper detects changes
    requiring a reset, this need is passed to subsequent helpers as a forced
    reset. This ensures that if filtering changed, sorting and pagination
    helpers return <code>{:reset_stream, valid_options}</code> even though their
    own parameters didn't change.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Pagination URL Synchronization</h4>
<p>
  The <code>page_changed</code> flag is returned by
  <code>PaginationHelpers.resolve_pagination_changes/5</code>. Imagine you're on
  penultimate page 5 and delete all its items. If you try to go to last page 6,
  validation will adjust back to page 5 (now the last page), and the URL must be
  updated to keep
</p>

<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This function handles four main types of user interactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"filter"</strong>
    <p>
      When users type in search boxes or change filter dropdowns, we process the
      form data using <code>FilteringHelpers.update_filter_options/3</code> and
      <code>validate_options/2</code>. Note that this bypasses
      <code>apply_defaults</code> because form inputs represent explicit user
      choices. We then update the URL with <code>push_patch</code> to sync URL
      with the new filter state.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"change-per-page"</strong>
    <p>
      When users change how many items they want to see per page, two things
      happen: we update the options with the new value using
      <code>PaginationHelpers.update_per_page_option/3</code> and update the URL
      with <code>push_patch</code>. Having the correct settings in the URL means
      users can bookmark or share their preferred view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"reset-stream"</strong>
    <p>
      After adding, editing, or deleting a language, users see a flash message
      with a "reset" link. Clicking this link fires the "reset-stream" action
      that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gets fresh data by calling <code>apply_options/3</code> with
        <code>force_reset=true</code>, which ensures everything is in its proper
        sorted position
      </li>
      <li>
        Cleans up by removing old flash messages with <code>clear_flash()</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"delete"</strong>
    <p>When users delete a language, we handle it gracefully in two steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, we update all our counts and mark the item as deleted using
        <code>PaginationHelpers.process_deleted/2</code>, which returns updated
        counts in <code>new_assigns</code> and a
        <code>marked_language</code> with the <code>:deleted</code> flag set to
        true. The deleted item stays visible (but grayed out with strikethrough)
        until users navigate away or refresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, we show a flash message with a reset link, encouraging users to
        refresh their view when they're ready to see the final, sorted list
        without the deleted item.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>Handles messages that come in asynchronously from two sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    From form components when the current user creates or updates a language
  </li>
  <li>From broadcasts when other users make changes</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Form Updates (Current User's Actions)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creating a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          When the form component emits a
          <code>{FormComponent, {:created, language}}</code> message, the
          LiveView invokes <code>PaginationHelpers.process_created/2</code> to
          update counts (incremented in <code>new_assigns</code>) and insert the
          new language into the stream. This function returns a
          <code>marked_language</code>—the new language record enriched with a
          <code>:created</code> flag set to <code>true</code> to indicate its
          newly created status. We then check if the item matches current
          filters using <code>FilteredLanguages.matches_filter?/2</code> to
          provide appropriate messaging. A flash message with a reset link is
          then displayed, allowing the user to refresh and sort.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Updating a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          Similarly, when the form component sends a
          <code>{FormComponent, {:updated, language}}</code> message,
          <code>PaginationHelpers.process_updated/1</code> is called to mark the
          language as updated in the stream. A flash message confirms the
          successful update to the user.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Broadcast Updates (Other Users' Actions)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Someone Creates a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          A <code>{FilteredLanguages, {:created, language}}</code> broadcast is
          received. We first check if the language matches current filters using
          <code>FilteredLanguages.matches_filter?/2</code>. If it matches, the
          LiveView invokes <code>PaginationHelpers.process_created/2</code> to
          update counts (updated counts are in <code>new_assigns</code>) and to
          add the language to the stream (<code>marked_language</code> is the
          new language record with a <code>:created</code> flag set to
          <code>true</code> to indicate its newly created status in UI). A flash
          message with a reset link notifies the user of the new addition and
          prompts them to refresh and sort the list. If it doesn't match
          filters, the update is ignored.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Someone Updates a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          When we receive a
          <code>{FilteredLanguages, {:updated, language}}</code> broadcast, we
          face a fundamental challenge: the broadcasted language contains the
          updated data, but we cannot determine from this alone whether the item
          previously matched our current filter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our solution uses a two-step approach based on visibility and count
          comparison:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>For visible items:</strong> If <code>language.id</code> is
            in <code>socket.assigns.visible_ids</code>, we know the item was
            already on our current page. We call
            <code>PaginationHelpers.process_updated/1</code> to mark it as
            updated in the stream and display an appropriate flash message.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>For non-visible items:</strong> We recalculate the total
            count using <code>FilteredLanguages.count_languages/1</code> and
            compare it to our stored count:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Count increased:</strong> The item now matches our
                filter. We treat this like a creation using
                <code>PaginationHelpers.process_created/2</code>, adding the
                item to the top of the stream with appropriate visual
                indicators.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Count decreased or unchanged:</strong> The item either
                moved out of our filter or the update didn't affect filter
                matching. We always update our stored count to maintain
                synchronization with the actual database state, even when the
                counts are identical. This defensive approach ensures our socket
                state never drifts from reality and prevents edge cases where
                multiple rapid updates might cause temporary inconsistencies.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This count-based approach elegantly handles complex filter
          transitions—such as when someone changes a country code from "EST" to
          "USA"—without requiring us to track the previous state of each item.
          The existing pagination logic automatically handles scenarios like
          redirecting users from invalid pages when the count decreases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Someone Deletes a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          If a language is deleted by another user, a
          <code>{FilteredLanguages, {:deleted, language}}</code> broadcast is
          received. If the deleted item was visible on the current page, the
          LiveView calls <code>PaginationHelpers.process_deleted/2</code> to
          update counts (updated counts are in <code>new_assigns</code>) and to
          mark the language as deleted in the stream (inserting a
          <code>marked_language</code> with the <code>:deleted</code> flag set
          to <code>true</code>). Appropriate notifications are then shown: if
          the deleted language was being edited by the current user, a flash
          message notifies him of the deletion and closes the edit modal;
          otherwise, a general flash message informs the user that the language
          has been deleted and will be removed upon navigation or refresh. If
          the item wasn't visible on the current page, only the total count is
          updated.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>sort_link/4</code></strong>
    <p>
      Generates sortable column header links using
      <code>SortingHelpers.get_sort_link_assigns/4</code> to determine the
      appropriate label, options, and indicator. The function renders a
      clickable link that updates the URL with new sorting parameters while
      displaying visual indicators for current sort state.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_url/2</code></strong>
    <p>
      Constructs complete URLs for navigation by merging filter parameters and
      encoding them as query strings. Accepts options and an optional base path,
      combining them into a properly formatted URL for LiveView patch
      operations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>merge_filter_params/1</code></strong>
    <p>
      Processes filter options by converting boolean values to strings, removing
      empty or nil values, and merging the cleaned filter map with other
      options. This ensures URL parameters are properly formatted and only
      contain meaningful filter criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: Given
      <code
        >%{filter: %{isofficial: true, language: "", countrycode: "US"}, page:
        2, sort_by: :language}</code
      >, returns
      <code
        >%{isofficial: "true", countrycode: "US", page: 2, sort_by:
        :language}</code
      >
      (boolean converted to string, empty language filter removed, filter map
      flattened).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_pagination_keep_params/1</code></strong>
    <p>
      Extracts non-pagination parameters from options by dropping page and
      per_page fields, then applying filter parameter merging. This function is
      essential for the pagination component's
      <code>keep_params</code> attribute, which preserves filtering and sorting
      state when users navigate between pages. Without this, clicking pagination
      links would reset all filters and sorting options back to defaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: When a user has filtered by "language=English" and sorted by
      "percentage", clicking "Next Page" preserves these settings in the URL
      instead of losing them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_flash_message_with_reset_link/1</code></strong>
    <p>
      Creates enhanced flash messages by embedding a clickable "reload and sort
      now" link within the message text. The link triggers the reset-stream
      event, providing users with immediate access to refresh functionality.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_row_class/1</code></strong>
    <p>
      Determines appropriate CSS classes for table rows based on language entry
      state flags (:created, :updated, :deleted). Returns specific background
      colors and styling to provide visual feedback about item status in the UI.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>format_percentage/2</code></strong>
    <p>
      Formats numerical values into percentage strings with configurable
      precision using the Number.Percentage library. Provides consistent
      percentage display formatting across the application with a
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>index.html.heex</h2>

<p>
  Beyond standard Phoenix LiveView markup, here are the key features specific to
  the filtered implementation:
</p>

<h4>Filter Form Integration</h4>
<p>
  The template includes a comprehensive filter form with multiple input types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text inputs for countrycode and language with debounced change events</li>
  <li>Select dropdown for official status filtering</li>
  <li>Number inputs for percentage range filtering (min/max)</li>
  <li>
    Form uses <code>phx-change="filter"</code> to trigger real-time filtering
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sortable Column Headers</h4>
<p>
  Column headers are generated using the <code>sort_link/4</code> helper
  function, which creates clickable links that update sorting parameters while
  preserving current filter state. Each column header displays visual indicators
  for current sort direction.
</p>

<h4>Count Management in UI</h4>
<p>
  The template uses different count variables to handle different UI
  requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>@count_all_summary</code></strong
    >: Used for "Showing X of Y" text, matches what users actually see on the
    page (including items marked as deleted but still visible)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>@count_all_pagination</code></strong
    >: Maintains stable page numbers until users explicitly reload or navigate,
    preventing pagination controls from changing unexpectedly during background
    updates
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This separation ensures accurate visual feedback while maintaining a stable
  user experience during real-time updates. For more details about count
  management, <a href="/grid/paginated">see the code breakdown here</a>.
</p>

<h4>Filter State Preservation</h4>
<p>
  The pagination component uses
  <code>keep_params={get_pagination_keep_params(@options)}</code> to preserve
  filtering and sorting state when users navigate between pages. This ensures
  that filter criteria and sort order are maintained across pagination
  interactions.
</p>

<h4>Navigation Behavior</h4>
<p>
  The pagination component includes a <code>hook="ScrollToTop"</code> that
  automatically scrolls back to the top of the page whenever the page number
  changes, providing a smoother navigation experience.
</p>

<h4>Stream Demonstration</h4>
<p>
  In the countrycode column, you'll notice:
  <code>&lt;dd>{Timex.now()}&lt;/dd></code>
</p>
<p>
  This timestamp is included purely for demonstration purposes—it shows when
  each row was stream-inserted, helping developers understand when and how the
  stream updates. In a production application, you would typically not include
  this debugging information.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>form_component.ex</h2>

<p>
  The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.GridLive.Filtered.FormComponent</code> adds two
  advanced features to standard Phoenix LiveView form handling: optimistic
  locking for concurrent updates and dynamic country code suggestions. Let's see
  how these work together across the component and schema:
</p>

<h3>Optimistic Locking</h3>
<p>
  When multiple users edit the same record simultaneously, we need to prevent
  one user from accidentally overwriting another's changes. Phoenix and Ecto
  provide optimistic locking to handle this. Here's how it works:
</p>

<h4>How to Implement</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add version tracking to your database table:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>add :lock_version, :integer, default: 0</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Add the field to your schema
        (LivePlayground.FilteredLanguages.Language):</strong
      >
    </p>
    <pre><code>field :lock_version, :integer, default: 0</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add force_change before optimistic_lock:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>|> force_change(:lock_version, record.lock_version)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This forced update ensures version check happens even when the form data
      itself hasn't changed. Without it, submitting an unchanged form would
      bypass optimistic locking - if another user had modified the data in the
      meantime, you wouldn't see a conflict message and the form would
      incorrectly close as if successful.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add optimistic lock to your changeset:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>|> optimistic_lock(:lock_version)</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Configure update in your context
        (LivePlayground.FilteredLanguages):</strong
      >
    </p>
    <pre><code>Repo.update(changeset, stale_error_field: :lock_version)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This crucial step ensures that version conflicts appear in
      <code>changeset.errors[:lock_version]</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Include the version in your form component:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;.input field={@form[:lock_version]} type="hidden" /&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handle version conflicts in your save function:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>if changeset.errors[:lock_version] do
  # Someone else updated the record while we were editing
  latest_language = FilteredLanguages.get_language!(language.id)
  # Show the latest version to the user
  # Let them merge their changes with the new version
end</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>
  Let's say two users, Alice and Bob, start editing the same language record:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Both load the record with <code>lock_version = 1</code></li>
  <li>
    Alice saves her changes first. The database updates the record and
    increments
    <code>lock_version</code> to 2
  </li>
  <li>
    When Bob tries to save, his form still has <code>lock_version = 1</code>
  </li>
  <li>Ecto sees the mismatch and returns a <code>:lock_version</code> error</li>
  <li>
    Our code then loads the latest version and lets Bob merge his changes with
    Alice's updates
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This approach is called "optimistic" because it assumes conflicts are rare and
  only checks for them at save time, rather than locking the record during the
  entire edit session.
</p>

<h3>Country Code Suggestions with Smart Validation</h3>
<p>
  Our form needs to both suggest valid country codes and validate the final
  input. While we could handle these as separate events, we combine them for
  better user experience. Here's why and how:
</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>
  If we validated the country code separately from suggestions, users would see
  "Code not found" errors while typing, even when valid suggestions are being
  displayed in the autocomplete list. This would be confusing and provide a poor
  user experience.
</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>
  We combine suggestion lookup and validation in the
  <code>validate</code> event:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When matches are found for autocomplete, we skip validation using
    <code>validate_countrycode_exists: false</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    When no matches exist, we enable validation using
    <code>validate_countrycode_exists: true</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    User starts typing a country code, triggering the
    <code>validate</code> event
  </li>
  <li>We search for matching codes to populate the autocomplete list</li>
  <li>
    If matches are found:
    <ul>
      <li>Skip database validation</li>
      <li>User sees suggestions without error messages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If no matches are found:
    <ul>
      <li>Perform database validation</li>
      <li>User sees "Code not found" if input is invalid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Improved Form Validation UX</h3>
<p>
  Our form handles validation in a way that prevents an overwhelming user
  experience. We've addressed a common problem with real-time validation:
</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>
  With standard Phoenix LiveView validation, the form shows error messages for
  all fields as soon as the user starts typing in <em>any</em> field - including
  required field errors for fields the user hasn't reached yet. This creates a
  poor experience where users see multiple red error messages before they've
  even had a chance to fill out the form.
</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>
  We modified the validation pipeline to separate different types of validation:
</p>

<pre><code>|> Map.update!(:errors, fn errors ->
  Enum.reject(errors, fn
    {_, {_, [validation: :required]}} -> true
    _ -> false
  end)
end)</code></pre>

<p>This approach:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Creates a changeset with all validations applied</li>
  <li>Removes only "required field" errors during typing</li>
  <li>Keeps other validation errors (like format, type, length)</li>
  <li>Sets the action to display the remaining errors</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    During form interaction, users get immediate feedback on format errors (like
    invalid email format)
  </li>
  <li>
    Required field errors are suppressed until form submission, preventing
    premature error messages
  </li>
  <li>
    When the user clicks Save, full validation occurs including required field
    checks
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The <code>Map.update!</code> function specifically modifies the
  <code>:errors</code> key in the changeset, filtering out required field errors
  while keeping all others. This surgical approach gives us precise control over
  which validation messages users see and when they see them.

<h2>filtered_languages.ex</h2>

<p>
  <code>LivePlayground.FilteredLanguages</code> handles three key aspects of our
  application:
</p>

<h4>Real-time Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>broadcast/2</code> sets up broadcasts for all database changes using
    the Phoenix PubSub message structure
    <code>{__MODULE__, {event, resource}}</code>. Note how create/update/delete
    functions end with <code>|> broadcast(:created)</code>,
    <code>|> broadcast(:updated)</code>, or <code>|> broadcast(:deleted)</code>.
    The broadcast uses <code>broadcast_from</code> with <code>self()</code> to
    ensure the originating process doesn't receive its own broadcast messages,
    preventing redundant updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provides <code>subscribe/0</code> function that, when called in LiveView's
    mount, enables the view to receive these broadcasts. This means when any
    connected user creates, updates, or deletes a language, all other connected
    users (except the initiator) will see these changes immediately, maintaining
    efficient real-time synchronization.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Advanced Filtering</h4>
<p>
  <code>list_languages/1</code> pipelines the base
  <code>Ecto.Query</code> through <code>filter/2</code>, <code>sort/2</code>,
  and <code>paginate/2</code>. While sorting and pagination simply wrap
  <code>order_by</code>, <code>limit</code>, and <code>offset</code>, filtering
  builds dynamic <code>WHERE</code> clauses and merits deeper explanation.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><code>Enum.reduce/3</code> with pattern matching</strong>
</p>
<p>A common use of <code>Enum.reduce</code> is this:</p>
<pre><code>Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], fn x, acc -> x * acc end)
# => 24
</code></pre>
<p>
  In contrast, <code>filter/2</code> uses multiple pattern-matched clauses to
  handle different filter keys in sequence.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a generic example of <code>Enum.reduce</code> using pattern matching on
  a map of operations:
</p>
<pre><code>operations = %{"add" => 2, "mul" => 3, "sub" => 1}
Enum.reduce(operations, 10, fn
  {"add", value}, acc -> acc + value
  {"mul", value}, acc -> acc * value
  {"sub", value}, acc -> acc - value
  _, acc -> acc
end)
# => 35
</code></pre>
<p>
  In <code>filter/2</code> each clause matches on the filter key and value type,
  transforming the accumulator (<code>query</code>) and skipping unrecognized
  filters via the catch-all clause.
</p>

<p>How <code>from l in query</code> Works</p>
<p>
  Think of <code>Ecto.Query</code> as an invisible bag that collects conditions.
  Each <code>from l in query, where: ...</code> call tucks one more condition
  into the bag without you seeing what's inside.
</p>

<p>The Mental Model:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>query = from(l in Language)</code> → Start with an empty bag</li>
  <li>
    <code>from l in query, where: l.countrycode == "US"</code> → Tuck in
    condition
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>from l in query, where: l.isofficial == true</code> → Tuck in
    condition
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Repo.all(final_query)</code> → Ecto opens the bag and builds: "WHERE
    countrycode = 'US' AND isofficial = true"
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Key Insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You never see the internals: The bag stays sealed until execution—you can't
    peek inside or manipulate the accumulated conditions directly
  </li>
  <li>
    Ecto does the heavy lifting: When you finally call
    <code>Repo.all/1</code>, Ecto opens the bag and automatically combines all
    conditions with AND logic
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is why <code>Enum.reduce/3</code> works perfectly—we're simply tucking
  conditions into the bag one by one, and Ecto handles all the SQL generation
  magic when we're ready to execute.
</p>

<h4>Optimistic Locking</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Configures <code>Repo.update</code> with
    <code>stale_error_field: :lock_version</code>, which enables version
    conflict detection. This setting ensures that
    <code>changeset.errors[:lock_version]</code> will be set in our form
    component when concurrent update conflicts occur.
  </li>
</ul>
