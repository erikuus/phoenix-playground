<p>
  The <code>UploadCloud</code> module demonstrates a complete file upload
  workflow in Phoenix LiveView, where images are uploaded directly to an AWS S3
  bucket instead of being saved locally. Specifically, it showcases how users
  can upload and manage images associated with specific locations (Estonian
  cities).
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function initializes the LiveView and configures the socket for handling
  file uploads via S3 and managing location data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Subscription</strong>: The LiveView process subscribes to updates
    using <code>Locations.subscribe/0</code>, ensuring it receives real-time
    broadcasts about location changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Form Initialization</strong>: The socket is assigned a form using
    <code>Locations.change_location/1</code>, which generates a changeset for
    handling location updates, including the selected location and any images
    being uploaded. The form tracks both the location data and file uploads,
    ensuring that when the form is submitted, both the location and the
    associated images are updated together. Additionally,
    <code>stream/2</code> is used to manage the list of locations in real-time,
    allowing any updates to the locations (including image uploads) to be
    reflected instantly in the UI without requiring a page refresh.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enabling File Uploads via S3</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>allow_upload/3</code> configures the upload process for the
        <code>:photos</code> field. By setting the <code>external</code> option
        to <code>&amp;presign_upload/2</code>, the actual file upload is handled
        by the client (browser) directly to AWS S3, instead of being uploaded
        through the Phoenix server. This means the LiveView app only generates
        presigned URLs and sends them to the browser, where the files are
        uploaded to S3 without passing through the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Files must be <code>.png</code> or <code>.jpg</code>, with a limit of 8
        entries and a maximum size of 10 MB.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>presign_upload/2</code></h3>
<p>
  This function is called to generate presigned URLs for S3, along with metadata
  like access keys and content type.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When the user selects files, <code>presign_upload/2</code> is triggered for
    each file. It uses the
    <code>SimpleS3Upload.sign_form_upload/3</code> function to generate the
    presigned URL and attaches metadata (URL, fields) to LiveView socket.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>metadata</strong> is passed to the client-side JavaScript as
    part of LiveView’s internal file upload lifecycle. The JavaScript uploader
    (S3 uploader) then reads this metadata to handle the file upload.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  The <code>render/1</code> function generates the HTML structure for the page,
  including the file upload interface and the display of uploaded images from
  S3:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Location Selection</strong>: A dropdown menu allows users to
      select a location from a list of Estonian cities.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>File Upload and Preview Components</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>&lt;.uploads_upload_area /&gt;</code></strong
        >: Handles the drag-and-drop area and file selection interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>&lt;.uploads_photo_preview_area /&gt;</code></strong
        >: Manages the display of file previews, showing thumbnails for accepted
        files and errors for rejected ones. These previews are updated in
        real-time based on user input.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>General Error Display</strong>: If any errors occur during file
      upload (such as exceeding file size or number limits), they are displayed
      using the <code>&lt;.error&gt;</code> component before rendering the file
      previews.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Uploaded Files Display</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A table displays locations along with their associated images:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Location Name</strong>: Displays the location's name.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thumbnails</strong>: Displays thumbnails of the images
            stored in the S3 bucket, fetched using the URLs stored in the
            <code>photos_s3</code> field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remove Images</strong>: Provides a link to remove image URLs
            from the location's <code>photos_s3</code> field in the database,
            but note that the images remain on S3 unless manually deleted.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function manages user interactions for uploading files to S3, form
  submission, and image management:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>"cancel" Event</strong>: Triggered when a user clicks the trash
      icon next to an uploading file. It removes the file from the upload queue
      using <code>cancel_upload/3</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>"validate" Event</strong>: Validates the form during user
      interaction, ensuring that the file upload UI works correctly and the
      selected files meet the required criteria.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"save" Event</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Triggered when the user submits the form to upload images to S3 for the
        selected location:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Retrieve Location</strong>: The
            <code>location_id</code> from the form is used to fetch the selected
            location from the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consume Uploads</strong>: The
            <code>consume_uploaded_entries/3</code>
            waits for the client-side JS to confirm the upload is complete, and
            then it processes the uploaded files to return absolute URLs to the
            AWS files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Update Location</strong>: The new image URLs are added to
            the <code>photos_s3</code> attribute, which is stored as a list of
            strings in the database (<code
              >field :photos_s3, {:array, :string}</code
            >). This allows each location to have multiple associated images
            stored in S3.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"remove_images" Event</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Triggered when the user clicks "Remove Images" next to a location in the
        table:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Retrieve Location</strong>: The <code>location_id</code> is
            used to fetch the selected location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Images</strong>: The <code>photos_s3</code> field is
            cleared (set to an empty list), updating the database to remove the
            association with the image URLs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Note</strong>: While the image URLs are removed from the
            database, the images themselves remain in the S3 bucket unless
            manually deleted.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  The <code>handle_info/2</code> function handles broadcasted updates to
  location data, ensuring that the UI stays in sync:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Purpose</strong>: When a location is updated (e.g., when new images
    are uploaded to S3 or existing ones are removed from the UI), the
    <code>handle_info/2</code> function listens for broadcast messages to update
    the UI in real-time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Functionality</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        It matches on the <code>{:update_location, location}</code> message
        containing the updated location data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses <code>stream_insert/3</code> to insert the updated location into
        the <code>:locations</code> stream, ensuring that all connected users
        see the changes without refreshing the page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>assign_form/2</code></strong
    >: Updates the form in the socket with the given changeset, allowing the
    form to reflect the latest validation state and errors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>filename/1</code></strong
    >: Generates a unique filename for each uploaded image by combining the
    entry’s UUID and original client name. This ensures files do not overwrite
    each other on S3.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Backend Logic and Broadcasting</h3>
<p>
  After successfully updating the database, it broadcasts the change to all
  connected clients using Phoenix PubSub. The
  <code>handle_info/2</code> function listens for these broadcast messages.
</p>
<h3>Summary of S3 Upload Workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>File Selection and <code>allow_upload/3</code> Setup</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>allow_upload/3</code> function is configured with the
        <code>external</code> option, which calls <code>presign_upload/2</code>.
        This tells LiveView to use external cloud storage (AWS S3) for uploads
        rather than handling the files locally on the Phoenix server.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Presigned URL Generation (<code>presign_upload/2</code>)</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For each file, <code>presign_upload/2</code> generates a presigned URL
        using the <code>SimpleS3Upload</code> module. This URL provides
        temporary, secure permission for the client to upload the file directly
        to S3.
      </li>
      <li>
        The generated presigned URL, along with required fields (e.g., AWS
        credentials, content type), is returned as part of the file metadata and
        passed to the browser through the LiveView socket.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>JavaScript S3 Uploader</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On the client side, the custom <strong>S3 uploader</strong> in
        <code>S3.js</code> takes over. It retrieves the presigned URL and
        metadata from the LiveView socket and uses them to upload the file
        directly to S3 via an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The uploader monitors upload progress and handles errors during the file
        transfer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Post-Upload Processing
        (<code>consume_uploaded_entries/3</code>)</strong
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Once the upload to S3 is complete, LiveView is notified.
        <code>consume_uploaded_entries/3</code> is then called to process the
        uploaded files.
      </li>
      <li>
        It extracts the S3 URLs from the metadata and returns the full, absolute
        URLs to the AWS files. These URLs are then used to update the
        <code>photos_s3</code> field in the database for the associated
        location.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
