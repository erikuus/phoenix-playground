<p>The <code>Paginate</code> module is designed to enable pagination for displaying city data within a dynamic web table. It handles user interactions related to changing the number of items displayed per page and navigating through pages. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the module:</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>This function is the entry point for setting up the LiveView with initial state. It calculates the total number of cities in the "USA" with <code>Cities.count_country_city("USA")</code>, and initializes pagination settings (<code>page: 1, per_page: 10</code>). These initial settings are stored in the socket's assigns using <code>assign_pagination_options</code>, preparing the LiveView for the first render.</p>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>The render function constructs the HTML using HEEx syntax, tailored for dynamic interaction:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A form allows users to select the number of cities displayed per page, with options like 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100.</li>
    <li>A responsive table displays cities, only rendered if <code>@cities</code> is not empty. It includes columns for city name, district, and population. The district is displayed conditionally based on the screen size, and the population numbers are formatted for readability.</li>
    <li>Pagination controls (<code>&lt;.pagination/&gt;</code>) enable navigation through pages based on current page settings and total city count, responding to user input without full page reloads.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code> for "select-per-page"</h3>
<p>This event handler adjusts the number of cities per page according to user selection. It converts the selected string value to an integer, recalculates the current page to prevent viewing an empty page (if the last page becomes non-existent with more items per page), and updates the state accordingly. The updated pagination settings are then applied to the socket assigns.</p>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code> for "select-page"</h3>
<p>This function manages page navigation events. It updates the current page based on user input and refreshes the view to show the newly selected page of cities. This is handled similarly to the "select-per-page" event, focusing on updating the page number in the pagination settings.</p>
<h3><code>assign_pagination_options/2</code></h3>
<p>Central to managing state updates, this function assigns updated city data and pagination options to the socket. It fetches the appropriate subset of city data based on the current pagination settings, ensuring the view is consistently synchronized with the user's navigation choices.</p>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>get_existing_page/3</code></strong>: Ensures the requested page number is valid after a change in <code>per_page</code> settings. It recalculates the maximum page number and adjusts the current page if necessary, ensuring users are never directed to a non-existent page.</li>
    <li><strong><code>ceil_div/2</code></strong>: Provides a utility for calculating the ceiling of an integer division, used here to determine the maximum number of pages based on the total count of items and the number per page. This function is designed for precision and efficiency in pagination calculations, avoiding floating-point arithmetic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This module exemplifies a robust implementation of pagination in a Phoenix LiveView application, showcasing real-time interactions with seamless updates to the user interface. It highlights best practices in handling user inputs, state management, and rendering dynamic content efficiently.</p>
