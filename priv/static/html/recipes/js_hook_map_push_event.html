<p>
  The <code>JsHookPushEvent</code> module demonstrates how to push JavaScript
  events from the frontend (using a JS Hook) back to Phoenix LiveView, enabling
  real-time interaction between the map and the LiveView. The key focus here is
  on handling map marker clicks and updating the LiveView based on these
  interactions.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>This function initializes the LiveView and prepares the necessary data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fetching Data</strong>: Retrieves a list of locations from the
    database using <code>Locations.list_est_location/0</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assigning Data</strong>: Assigns the fetched locations to the socket
    under the <code>:locations</code> key, making them available for rendering
    in the <code>render/1</code> function.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>Defines the HTML structure sent to the client:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Map Hook Element</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>div</code> with <code>id="map-hook"</code> is the target for
        the JS hook and must have a unique <code>id</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>phx-hook="MapPushEvents"</code> attribute attaches the JS hook
        named <code>MapPushEvents</code> (which is defined in
        <code>app.js</code>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>List of Locations</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Displays a list of location names with an <code>li</code> element for
        each location.
      </li>
      <li>
        The selected location is highlighted based on the state of
        <code>@selected_location_id</code>, which is dynamically updated when a
        marker is clicked.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>Handles events pushed from the frontend to the LiveView:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"get-locations"</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This event is triggered when the map is initialized in the JS hook.
      </li>
      <li>
        LiveView responds by pushing the <code>:locations</code> assign (the
        list of locations) back to the frontend, where it’s used to populate the
        map with markers and re-center the map based on the bounds of all
        markers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"marker-clicked"</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This event is triggered when a marker on the map is clicked.</li>
      <li>
        The event payload contains the <code>location_id</code> of the clicked
        marker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updates the socket assigns to set <code>:selected_location_id</code>,
        causing the corresponding location in the list to be highlighted.
        Scrolling the location into view happens within the JS hook.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript Hook (<code>MapPushEvents</code>)</h3>
<p>
  The JS hook is critical for pushing events from the client-side to LiveView:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hook Registration (<code>app.js</code>)</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>MapPushEvents</code> hook is registered in
        <code>assets/js/app.js</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        This hook is made available to LiveView through the
        <code>LiveSocket</code> configuration.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Hook Implementation (<code>map-push-events.js</code>)</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Mounted Lifecycle</strong>: When the LiveView component is
        mounted, the <code>mounted()</code> function in
        <code>MapPushEvents</code> is triggered.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Map Initialization</strong>: Inside the
            <code>mounted()</code> function, the <code>Map</code> class is
            instantiated, setting up the map with center coordinates and zoom
            level. During this process, a callback function is added to handle
            marker clicks. This callback triggers the
            <code>pushEvent("marker-clicked")</code>, which in turn triggers the
            corresponding event in LiveView. The specifics of how this is tied
            to each marker are handled within the JavaScript, but the key point
            is that clicking a marker sends the event back to LiveView for
            further processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Requesting Location Data</strong>: Immediately after map
            initialization, the hook calls
            <code>this.pushEvent("get-locations")</code> to request location
            data from LiveView. The LiveView handles this event and sends back
            the location data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Populating the Map</strong>: When the location data is
            received from LiveView, markers are placed on the map based on the
            location details.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scroll to View</strong>: After updating the selected location in
        LiveView, the corresponding location in the list is scrolled into view
        on the client-side using the <code>scrollIntoView()</code> method in the
        JS hook.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Flow from LiveView to JS and Back</h3>
<p>
  Here’s how data and events flow between the Elixir backend and the JS map
  library:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>LiveView to JS (Initial Setup)</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        After the LiveView is mounted, the JS hook immediately requests location
        data by pushing the <code>"get-locations"</code> event to LiveView.
      </li>
      <li>
        LiveView handles this event and pushes the location data back to the
        frontend.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>JS to LiveView</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The JS hook processes the received location data and places markers on
        the map.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a marker is clicked, the JS hook pushes a
        <code>"marker-clicked"</code> event back to LiveView, passing along the
        <code>location_id</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>LiveView to DOM Update</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        LiveView handles the <code>"marker-clicked"</code> event, updates its
        state (e.g., sets <code>@selected_location_id</code>), and re-renders
        the DOM to highlight the selected location in the list. Scrolling the
        selected location into view happens within the JS hook.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
