<p>
  The <code>StreamInsert</code> module uses LiveView's streaming capabilities to
  efficiently handle changes in a list of cities displayed to the user. Stream
  operations (insert, update, delete) only modify the specific DOM elements
  associated with the affected cities, rather than re-rendering the entire
  table. This is achieved through LiveView's streaming system, which tracks each
  item by its DOM ID and sends targeted updates to the browser.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Upon mounting, the LiveView initializes the stream for city data. It
  configures the stream with a unique DOM ID for each entry, enabling precise
  targeting for updates and removals. The cities are fetched with
  <code>Cities.list_country_city("EST")</code>, and an empty form for new city
  data input is set up.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Custom IDs with <code>stream_configure</code></strong
    >: By default, LiveView streams use each item's primary key as the DOM ID
    (e.g., <code>id="cities-123"</code>). This implementation uses
    <code>stream_configure</code> with a custom <code>dom_id</code> function to
    create composite IDs like <code>city-EST-123</code>. This pattern is useful
    when you need predictable DOM IDs for CSS targeting, JavaScript integration,
    or when dealing with items that might have duplicate IDs across different
    contexts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>get_empty_form/0</code></h3>
<p>
  Creates a fresh form for city input by generating a changeset from an empty
  <code>City</code> struct using <code>Cities.change_city()</code> and
  converting it to a form with <code>to_form()</code>. This helper function is
  strategically placed immediately after <code>mount/3</code> following the
  stepdown rule, since <code>mount/3</code> calls it during initialization. The
  function is reused after successful form submissions to reset the input
  fields.
</p>

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>The rendering function outlines the structure of the HTML:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Form for Input</strong>: A form that captures data for a new city.
    It is configured to trigger the "save" event on submission.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic Table Display</strong>: A table displays each city's name,
    district, and population. The table is enhanced with dynamic stream
    identifiers for each row, allowing for real-time updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Delete Functionality</strong>: Each city has a delete button,
    equipped with an action to trigger the "delete" event. This setup ensures
    that the specific row can be efficiently removed from the DOM upon deletion.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Real-Time Feedback</strong>: Each city row displays a timestamp
    using <code>{Timex.now()}</code> in the template. This serves as a visual
    proof that only newly inserted rows are re-rendered - existing rows retain
    their original timestamps, demonstrating LiveView's selective update
    capability. When you add a new city, only that row shows the current time,
    while all other rows keep their previous timestamps.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Important: Use <code>phx-update="stream"</code> on the container</h4>
<p>
  When rendering streamed entries manually (not via
  <code>&lt;.table&gt;</code>), give the parent element a stable
  <code>id</code> and set <code>phx-update="stream"</code>. Otherwise, unrelated
  patches (like form validation) can clear the list in the DOM.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-elixir">&lt;div id="cities" phx-update="stream"&gt;
  &lt;div :for={{dom_id, city} &lt;- @streams.cities} id={dom_id}&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  Note: The example here uses the <code>&lt;.table&gt;</code> component, which
  already applies the correct update strategy for streams. Add
  <code>phx-update="stream"</code> only when rolling your own markup.
</p>

<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This function handles two types of user interactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"save"</strong>
    <p>
      Triggered when the city form is submitted. It transforms the form
      parameters by adding <code>countrycode: "EST"</code> since this view only
      displays Estonian cities - all new cities should automatically be Estonian
      to appear in this filtered list. On successful creation, first the form is
      reset with <code>assign(:form, get_empty_form())</code>, then the new city
      is inserted at the beginning of the stream with
      <code>stream_insert(:cities, city, at: 0)</code>. The
      <code>at: 0</code> parameter ensures new cities appear at the top of the
      list. On failure, only the form is updated with validation errors, leaving
      the existing city stream unchanged.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"delete"</strong>
    <p>
      Triggered when a user clicks the delete button for a specific city. It
      fetches the city by ID and deletes it from the database, then removes the
      city from the stream using
      <code>stream_delete(socket, :cities, city)</code>. This operation only
      affects the specific DOM element associated with that city, demonstrating
      the performance benefits of streaming updates.
    </p>
  </li>
  <h3>Performance Benefits of Streaming</h3>
  <p>
    The streaming approach provides significant performance advantages over
    traditional <code>assign</code> updates. When using
    <code>assign(:cities, updated_list)</code>, LiveView would need to diff the
    entire list and potentially re-render all table rows. With streams, only the
    specific rows that changed are updated in the DOM. This is particularly
    beneficial for large datasets where adding, updating, or removing individual
    items becomes a constant-time operation rather than linear with the list
    size.
  </p>
</ul>
