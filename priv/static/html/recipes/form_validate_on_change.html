<p>
  The <code>FormValidateOnChange</code> module is designed for adding new city
  records to the database with real-time validation feedback. Unlike forms that
  only validate on submit, this module validates as users type, providing
  immediate feedback on input validity. This approach helps users catch and fix
  errors early, creating a more interactive experience, though it can be more
  resource-intensive due to frequent validation requests.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  The function initializes the LiveView by loading a list of cities for a
  specific country using <code>Cities.list_country_city/1</code>. It also
  prepares an empty form for new city entries by calling
  <code>get_empty_form/0</code>. This helper first creates a blank
  <code>City</code> struct, then wraps it in a changeset using
  <code>Cities.change_city/1</code> to enable validation rules and error
  tracking. Finally, it converts the changeset into a LiveView form structure
  using <code>to_form/1</code>, so the template can display validation errors
  and preserve user input.
</p>

<h3>What is a Changeset?</h3>
<p>
  As a developer, you'll use <code>changeset</code> all the time in Phoenix and
  Ecto, but it's easy to miss what it actually does. Think of a changeset as a
  smart container for user input: it holds the original struct (like
  <code>City</code>), any new data the user tries to submit, and a set of rules
  for what's valid. When you build a changeset, you tell it what fields are
  required, what values are allowed, and any custom checks you need. If the user
  enters something invalid, the changeset collects those errors so you can show
  helpful messages in your form. In LiveView, changesets are the bridge between
  your backend validation and the interactive UIâ€”they keep user input,
  validation, and error messages all in sync, so you never lose what the user
  typed, even if there are mistakes.

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>The rendering function constructs the HTML:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A form for city data input configured to handle both "validate" and "save"
    events. It includes input fields for the city's name, district, and
    population, each debounced to delay event firing for 2000 milliseconds,
    reducing the frequency of validation requests as the user types.
  </li>
  <li>
    A table displaying the list of cities, conditionally shown if city data is
    present. Each city's details are formatted for both mobile and desktop
    views.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This function handles two main types of user interactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"validate"</strong>
    <p>This event handler processes real-time form validation as users type:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It adds the necessary country code to the form parameters and creates a
        changeset using <code>Cities.change_city/1</code> with the current user
        input.
      </li>
      <li>
        The changeset has its action set to <code>:validate</code> using
        <code>Map.put(changeset, :action, :validate)</code>. This tells the
        changeset to show validation errors immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        The changeset is converted to a form using <code>to_form/1</code> and
        assigned back to the socket. This updates the form state with any
        validation errors or confirmations, allowing users to see feedback
        immediately without submitting the form.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"save"</strong>
    <p>This event handler processes form submissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the city is successfully created using
        <code>Cities.create_city/1</code>, the new city is prepended to the list
        of cities in the LiveView's state using <code>update/3</code>, the form
        is reset to an empty state using <code>get_empty_form/0</code>, and a
        flash message is displayed to the user. This ensures the UI immediately
        reflects the new entry and provides feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there's a validation error, the changeset is converted back to form
        state using <code>to_form/1</code> to display validation errors. The
        form is re-rendered with the user's input and corresponding error
        messages, allowing users to correct mistakes without losing their input.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative List Management Strategies</h3>
<p>
  While this demo uses simple prepending for immediate feedback, production
  applications often need more sophisticated list management:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use <code>Enum.sort_by/3</code> to maintain alphabetical ordering after
    adding cities:
    <pre><code>socket
|> update(:cities, fn cities ->
  [city | cities]
  |> Enum.sort_by(& &1.name, :asc)
end)</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    For large datasets, streams provide efficient handling of thousands of items
    with automatic DOM updates. See the dedicated stream recipes for detailed
    examples and implementation patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine with pagination for very large city lists, allowing users to
    navigate through results without overwhelming the interface.
  </li>
</ul>
