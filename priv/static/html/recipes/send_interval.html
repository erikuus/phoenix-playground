<p>
  The <code>SendInterval</code> module is designed to perform countdown. Using
  <code>:timer.send_interval/3</code> is a way to make the server send messages
  to itself at regular intervals. In this context, it's being used to update the
  countdown every second.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>Initializes the LiveView with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Starting a timer that sends <code>:tick</code> messages to the LiveView
    process every second if the LiveView is connected to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculating an <code>expiration_time</code> which is set to 2 days from the
    current UTC time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assigning <code>expiration_time</code> and the initial
    <code>seconds_remaining</code> to the socket.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>terminate/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Ensures proper cleanup when the LiveView process ends by canceling any active
  timer. This prevents memory leaks and ensures that timer processes don't
  continue running after the user navigates away from the page. The function
  checks if a timer reference exists before attempting cancellation, preventing
  errors when no timer was created (such as during initial server-side rendering
  before the WebSocket connection is established).
</p>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  Defines how to render the current state to HTML. It displays the remaining
  time in a human-readable format using the
  <code>format_duration/1</code> helper function.
</p>
<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Receives the <code>:tick</code> messages from the timer. It recalculates the
  <code>seconds_remaining</code> and only updates the socket assigns if the
  value has actually changed. This optimization prevents unnecessary re-renders
  when the countdown hasn't progressed, improving performance by avoiding
  redundant DOM updates.
</p>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<h4><code>seconds_remaining/1</code></h4>
<p>
  Calculates the difference in seconds between the
  <code>expiration_time</code> and the current UTC time, returning 0 if the
  expiration time has passed.
</p>
<h4><code>format_duration/1</code></h4>
<p>
  Formats the duration from seconds into a human-readable string. It's using the
  <code>Timex</code> library's duration formatting capabilities. If the seconds
  are greater than zero, it converts the seconds to a
  <code>Duration</code> struct and then formats it. If the seconds are zero or
  less, it returns "Expired".
