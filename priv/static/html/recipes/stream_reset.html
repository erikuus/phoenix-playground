<p>
  The <code>StreamReset</code> module handles the creation, update, and viewing
  of city entries directly within a stream, highlighting how to use stream reset
  in conjunction with navigation to ensure data consistency and optimize
  resource use.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>Uses pattern matching to handle two different initialization scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>With <code>country_id</code> parameter</strong>: Directly loads the
    specified country using <code>Countries.get_country!/1</code>. If the
    country doesn't exist, Phoenix automatically returns a 404 error,
    eliminating the need for manual error handling.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Without <code>country_id</code> parameter</strong>: Loads all Baltic
    countries and automatically selects the first one. If no countries exist,
    initializes with empty state. This provides a sensible default when users
    visit the page without specifying a country.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Both scenarios delegate to <code>init_tab/4</code> for consistent state
  initialization. Setting up streams in <code>mount/3</code> rather than
  <code>handle_params/3</code> is critical because:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Initializing streams in <code>handle_params/3</code> would recreate the
    entire stream every time any parameter changes (like opening an edit modal).
    This defeats the primary purpose of streams, which is to maintain existing
    DOM elements and only update what's necessary. Stream initialization should
    only happen once per LiveView connection.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>mount/3</code> runs once when the LiveView connects, making it ideal
    for establishing initial data streams and ensuring all necessary data is
    available for the first render.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>init_tab/4</code></h3>
<p>
  Initializes socket state with country data, selected country, cities empty
  flag, and city stream. This function follows the coding convention of assigns
  before streams, ensuring UI state is set before data streams are established.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>@cities_empty</code> is needed to conditionally display "No cities
    available" alerts and hide the table header. This explicit state tracking is
    necessary because, due to the internal structure of LiveView streams, there
    is no direct way to check for emptiness within the template after state
    changes (the stream API does not provide a reliable or supported way to
    check for an empty stream in the template after LiveView state changes). The
    <code>:cities_empty</code> assign provides a reliable way to show/hide UI
    elements based on data availability.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>handle_params/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Extracts parameters from the URL and manages country tab switching. When a
  country change is detected (by comparing the current
  <code>selected_country</code> with the one from the URL), it calls
  <code>change_tab/2</code> to update the stream, then delegates to
  <code>apply_action/3</code> for form state management.
</p>

<h3><code>change_tab/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles country switching by fetching new city data and resetting the stream.
  Uses <code>stream(:cities, cities, reset: true)</code> to completely replace
  existing stream content, which is more efficient than individual insertions
  when changing entire datasets.
</p>

<h3><code>apply_action/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles different URL-based actions and prepares the appropriate form state:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>For <code>:index</code> action</strong>: Creates an empty form for
    adding new cities by initializing a blank <code>City</code> struct and
    setting the button title to "Add".
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>For <code>:edit</code> action</strong>: Retrieves the specific city
    using <code>Cities.get_city!/1</code> (which handles 404 errors
    automatically), populates the form with existing city data, and sets the
    button title to "Update".
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>assign_form/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Converts a changeset into a form-ready structure using
  <code>to_form/1</code> and assigns it to the socket. This centralization
  ensures consistent form handling across create and edit operations.
</p>

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  Defines the HTML output with several key features that demonstrate stream
  management patterns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dual Alert System</strong>: Uses two different alerts to handle
    empty states - one for when no countries are available (<code
      >@countries == []</code
    >) and another for when a country is selected but has no cities
    (<code>@cities_empty</code>). The cities alert requires explicit state
    tracking because LiveView streams cannot be reliably checked for emptiness
    within templates after state changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic Country Tabs with Stream Reset</strong>: Allows users to
    switch between different countries using <code>.tabs</code> component. Each
    tab change triggers a complete stream reset via <code>change_tab/2</code>,
    demonstrating how to efficiently replace entire datasets while maintaining
    stream performance benefits.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Conditional Form Display</strong>: Shows the city creation/edit form
    only when countries are available.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stream-Powered City Table</strong>: The table uses
    <code>@streams.cities</code> to efficiently render city data. Only the rows
    that change are re-rendered, not the entire table, showcasing the core
    benefit of LiveView streams for large datasets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pedagogical Stream Timestamps</strong>: Each city row displays a
    timestamp showing when it was rendered (<code>Timex.now()</code>). This is a
    debugging/demonstration feature that visually proves that only updated rows
    are re-rendered by the stream, not the entire table. When you edit a city,
    only that specific row's timestamp updates, demonstrating LiveView's
    selective rendering capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Optimistic UI with JavaScript</strong>: The delete action uses
    <code>JS.push("delete", value: %{city_id: city.id}) |> hide("##{id}")</code>
    to immediately hide the row before the server confirms deletion, providing
    instant visual feedback while the deletion processes in the background.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles form validation, saving, and deletion with proper state management
  ordering:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"validate" event</strong>: Updates the form changeset in real-time
    as users type, setting the changeset action to <code>:validate</code> to
    trigger field-level validation without attempting to save.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"save" event</strong>: Delegates to <code>save_city/3</code> which
    handles both create and update operations. On success, it follows the coding
    convention: assigns before streams, streams before flash messages. For
    create operations, it sets <code>cities_empty</code> to false and inserts at
    position 0 to show new cities at the top.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"delete" event</strong>: Removes the city from the database using
    <code>Cities.delete_city/1</code> and updates the stream with
    <code>stream_delete/3</code>. Note that <code>cities_empty</code> is not
    updated on delete to keep the code simple - the table header remains visible
    even when empty.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>save_city/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles both create and update operations for cities. For create operations,
  it sets <code>cities_empty</code> to false and inserts at position 0 to show
  new cities at the top of the list, ensuring immediate visibility of the most
  recently added city.
</p>
