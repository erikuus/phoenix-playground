<p>
  The <code>BroadcastStream</code> module demonstrates the powerful combination
  of Phoenix PubSub broadcasting with LiveView streaming capabilities and
  optimistic locking. This creates a real-time collaborative environment where
  multiple users can simultaneously work with city data while maintaining data
  consistency and preventing conflicts. The module manages cities in the "EST"
  region, providing immediate updates across all connected clients while
  ensuring data integrity through version control.
</p>

<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Initializes the LiveView session by setting up both PubSub subscription for
  real-time updates and streaming infrastructure for efficient data management.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Uses <code>Cities.subscribe()</code> to listen for city changes from other
    users, but only when the socket is connected to prevent unnecessary
    subscriptions during server-side pre-rendering. The subscription uses a
    global topic approach (all city updates) rather than resource-specific
    topics, which is appropriate for this demonstration where all users work
    with the same city dataset.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sets up a stream with
    <code>stream(socket, :cities, Cities.list_country_city("EST"))</code> to
    efficiently manage the city list. Streams are LiveView's solution for
    handling large datasets without memory overhead - only the changes are
    transmitted to clients, not the entire dataset on every update.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>terminate/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Properly cleans up the PubSub subscription when the LiveView session ends
  using <code>Cities.unsubscribe()</code>. This prevents memory leaks in the
  PubSub registry and ensures that broadcast messages aren't sent to dead
  processes, maintaining optimal application performance.
</p>

<h3><code>handle_params/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Extracts parameters from the URL and delegates action handling based on these
  parameters, using <code>apply_action/3</code>.
</p>

<h3><code>apply_action/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Differentiates actions such as viewing the main index or editing a specific
  city:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Index Action</strong>: Prepares the interface for adding a new city
    by creating an empty <code>City</code> struct and setting up the form with
    "Add" as the button title.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edit Action</strong>: Retrieves an existing city using
    <code>Cities.get_city!/1</code> and prepares the form for editing with
    "Update" as the button title.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>set_form/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Helper function that centralizes form setup logic. It assigns the button
  title, city data, and creates a form from the city changeset.
</p>

<h3><code>assign_form/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Helper function that converts an Ecto changeset into a form structure using
  <code>to_form/1</code> and assigns it to the socket's <code>:form</code> key.
</p>

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  Renders an interactive interface combining form input with real-time data
  display:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Form with Optimistic Locking</strong>: The form includes a hidden
    <code>lock_version</code> field that's crucial for preventing concurrent
    update conflicts. When multiple users edit the same city, this version
    number helps detect conflicts and prevents data loss.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stream-Powered Table</strong>: Displays cities using
    <code>@streams.cities</code>, which efficiently updates only the rows that
    have changed. The table includes real-time timestamps showing when each row
    was last updated in the stream, demonstrating that only modified rows are
    re-rendered.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>Handles user interactions with different patterns for each event type:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Delete</strong>: Uses
    <code>JS.push("delete", value: %{id: city.id}) |> hide("##{id}")</code> to
    immediately hide the row from the UI while the delete operation processes.
    Since <code>broadcast_from</code> excludes <code>self()</code>, the
    originating user sees the immediate visual feedback from the JavaScript hide
    command, while other users receive the update via broadcast.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validate</strong>: Uses <code>Map.put(:action, :validate)</code> to
    trigger error display in the form.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Save</strong>: Delegates to <code>save_city/3</code> to handle the
    complexity of create vs. update logic.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>save_city/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles form submissions with different logic based on the current action:
  <code>:index</code> for creating cities (since the create form is always
  present in the index view) and <code>:edit</code> for updating existing
  cities.
</p>

<h4>Create Operation (<code>:index</code>)</h4>
<p>
  Simple success/error pattern: after successful database operation, the new
  city is inserted at the top of the stream and the user gets success feedback
  before being redirected to the index.
</p>

<h4>Update Operation (<code>:edit</code>)</h4>
<p>
  More complex due to optimistic locking conflict detection. On success, it
  follows the same pattern as create. However, when
  <code>changeset.errors[:lock_version]</code> is detected, it means another
  user modified the city while this user was editing. The system then:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fetches the latest version from the database</li>
  <li>Updates both the city reference and form with the latest data</li>
  <li>Shows an error message explaining the conflict</li>
  <li>Lets the user review the changes and decide how to proceed</li>
</ol>

<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Processes real-time broadcasts with sophisticated logic for different
  scenarios:
</p>

<h4>Why Update Broadcasts Don't Always Update Forms</h4>
<p>
  This is the key insight for optimistic locking: when another user updates the
  city being edited, the system deliberately does NOT update the form data. This
  preserves the original <code>lock_version</code> in the form, allowing
  conflict detection to work when the editing user submits.
</p>

<h4>Context-Aware Notifications</h4>
<p>The system provides different user experiences based on context:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Same city being edited</strong>: Update stream only, no confusing
    "another user" messages
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Different city</strong>: Update stream and show notification about
    other users' activity
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Deleted city being edited</strong>: Close form and redirect with
    clear explanation
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimistic Locking Implementation</h3>
<p>The system prevents concurrent update conflicts through version tracking:</p>

<h4>How to Implement</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add version tracking to your database table:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>add :lock_version, :integer, default: 0</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add the field to your schema:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>field :lock_version, :integer, default: 0</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add force_change before optimistic_lock:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>|> force_change(:lock_version, city.lock_version)
|> optimistic_lock(:lock_version)</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>force_change</code> ensures version checks happen even when form
      data hasn't changed, preventing silent conflicts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configure update in your context:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>Repo.update(changeset, stale_error_field: :lock_version)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures version conflicts appear in
      <code>changeset.errors[:lock_version]</code> where your LiveView can
      detect them.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Include the version in your form:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;.input field={@form[:lock_version]} type="hidden" /&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handle conflicts in your save function:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>if changeset.errors[:lock_version] do
  # Fetch latest version and update form
  # Let user merge their changes
end</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>When two users edit the same city simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Both load the record with <code>lock_version = 25</code></li>
  <li>
    Alice saves firstâ€”database increments to <code>lock_version = 26</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Bob's form still has <code>lock_version = 25</code> thanks to the broadcast
    logic
  </li>
  <li>
    Ecto detects the mismatch and returns a <code>:lock_version</code> error
  </li>
  <li>
    Bob sees the latest data and can merge his changes with Alice's updates
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>cities.ex</h2>

<p>
  <code>LivePlayground.Cities</code> provides the infrastructure for real-time
  collaborative city management through Phoenix PubSub broadcasting and
  optimistic locking configuration.
</p>

<p><strong>Real-time Broadcasting</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>broadcast/2</code> uses <code>broadcast_from</code> with
    <code>self()</code> to prevent the originating process from receiving its
    own messages, avoiding redundant updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    All database operations ending with <code>_broadcast</code> automatically
    notify other connected users of changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>subscribe/0</code> enables LiveViews to receive broadcasts by
    subscribing to a specific PubSub topic. The topic
    <code>inspect(__MODULE__)</code> creates a single channel for all city
    updates across the entire application. This approach works well for small
    datasets where all users need to see all changes, but for larger
    applications you might use resource-specific topics like
    <code>"country:#{country.id}"</code> to only broadcast city changes within
    specific countries, reducing message volume and improving performance.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Optimistic Locking</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>update_city_broadcast/2</code> includes
    <code>stale_error_field: :lock_version</code>, which makes version conflicts
    detectable in changesets.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Message Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    All broadcasts follow <code>{__MODULE__, {event, resource}}</code> format,
    preventing message conflicts and ensuring maintainability.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>city.ex</h2>

<p>
  <code>LivePlayground.Cities.City</code> schema implements optimistic locking
  through changeset configuration:
</p>

<p><strong>Optimistic Locking Setup</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>force_change(:lock_version, city.lock_version)</code> ensures version
    checks occur even when form data is unchanged. Without this, if a user opens
    an edit form, another user modifies the same record, and then the first user
    submits without changing anything, the optimistic locking check would be
    bypassed entirely. The form would close successfully even though the
    underlying data had changed, creating a false sense of success.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>optimistic_lock(:lock_version)</code> tells Ecto to use this field for
    concurrency control.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ecto automatically increments <code>lock_version</code> on each successful
    update when using <code>optimistic_lock/1</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
