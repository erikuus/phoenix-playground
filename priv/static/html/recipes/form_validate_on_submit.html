<p>
  The <code>FormValidateOnSubmit</code> module is designed for adding new city
  records to the database. Unlike forms that validate on every change, this
  module only validates when the user submits the form. This approach reduces
  unnecessary validation feedback and is useful for simpler forms or when you
  want to avoid distracting users with immediate error messages.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  The function initializes the LiveView by loading a list of cities for a
  specific country using <code>Cities.list_country_city/1</code>. It also
  prepares an empty form for new city entries by calling
  <code>get_empty_form/0</code>. This helper first creates a blank
  <code>City</code> struct, then wraps it in a changeset using
  <code>Cities.change_city/1</code> to enable validation rules and error
  tracking. Finally, it converts the changeset into a LiveView form structure,
  so the template can display validation errors and preserve user input.
</p>

<h3>What is a Changeset?</h3>
<p>
  As a developer, you'll use <code>changeset</code> all the time in Phoenix and
  Ecto, but it's easy to miss what it actually does. Think of a changeset as a
  smart container for user input: it holds the original struct (like
  <code>City</code>), any new data the user tries to submit, and a set of rules
  for what's valid. When you build a changeset, you tell it what fields are
  required, what values are allowed, and any custom checks you need. If the user
  enters something invalid, the changeset collects those errors so you can show
  helpful messages in your form. In LiveView, changesets are the bridge between
  your backend validation and the interactive UIâ€”they keep user input,
  validation, and error messages all in sync, so you never lose what the user
  typed, even if there are mistakes.

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>The rendering function constructs the HTML:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A form for city data submission, configured to handle the "save" event. It
    includes input fields for the city's name, district, and population, along
    with a save button.
  </li>
  <li>
    A dynamic table displays the list of cities. If there are cities available
    (<code>@cities != []</code>), it renders each city's name, district, and
    population. Responsive design elements are included for different viewing
    devices.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This event handler processes form submissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the city is successfully created using
    <code>Cities.create_city/1</code>, the new city is prepended to the list of
    cities in the LiveView's state using <code>update/3</code>, the form is
    reset to an empty state, and a flash message is displayed to the user.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there's an error (typically a validation failure), the changeset is
    converted back to form state using
    <code>to_form/1</code> to display validation errors. The form is re-rendered
    with the user's input and corresponding error messages, allowing users to
    correct mistakes without losing their input.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative List Management Strategies</h3>
<p>
  While this demo uses simple prepending for immediate feedback, production
  applications often need more sophisticated list management:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use <code>Enum.sort_by/3</code> to maintain alphabetical ordering after
    adding cities:
    <pre><code>socket
|> update(:cities, fn cities ->
  [city | cities]
  |> Enum.sort_by(& &1.name, :asc)
end)</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    For large datasets, streams provide efficient handling of thousands of items
    with automatic DOM updates. See the dedicated stream recipes for detailed
    examples and implementation patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine with pagination for very large city lists, allowing users to
    navigate through results without overwhelming the interface.
  </li>
</ul>
