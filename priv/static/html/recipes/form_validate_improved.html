<p>
  The <code>FormValidateImproved</code> module improves real-time form
  validation in Phoenix LiveView by preventing users from seeing required field
  errors before they've interacted with those fields. This creates a calmer,
  less distracting experience.
</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>
  By default, LiveView validation shows errors for all fields—including required
  fields—even if the user hasn't touched them yet. This means users see multiple
  error messages as soon as they start typing, which can be confusing and
  discouraging.
</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>
  The validation pipeline is adjusted to filter out only "required field" errors
  during typing, while keeping other validation errors visible. This is done by
  updating the changeset's <code>:errors</code> key:
</p>

<pre><code>|> Map.update!(:errors, fn errors ->
  Enum.reject(errors, fn
    {_, {_, [validation: :required]}} -> true
    _ -> false
  end)
end)</code></pre>

<p>This approach:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Creates a changeset with all validations applied</li>
  <li>Removes only "required field" errors during typing</li>
  <li>Keeps other validation errors (such as format, type, or length)</li>
  <li>Sets the action so remaining errors are displayed immediately</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    While filling out the form, users see instant feedback for format errors
    (for example, entering non-numeric text in the Population field)
  </li>
  <li>
    Required field errors are hidden until the user submits the form, so users
    aren't distracted by errors for fields they haven't filled in yet
  </li>
  <li>
    On Save, all validations—including required fields—are checked and shown
  </li>
</ol>
