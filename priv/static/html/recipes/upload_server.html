<p>
  The <code>UploadToServer</code> module demonstrates a complete file upload
  workflow in Phoenix LiveView, covering everything from creating the file
  upload UI to handling file uploads on the server. Specifically, it showcases
  how users can upload and manage images associated with specific locations
  (Estonian cities). This functionality enables users to select a location,
  upload images, and remove those images when needed. The uploaded images are
  then displayed in a table alongside the location name.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function initializes the LiveView and configures the socket for handling
  file uploads and managing location data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Subscription</strong>: The LiveView process subscribes to updates
    using <code>Locations.subscribe/0</code>, ensuring it receives real-time
    broadcasts about location changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Form Initialization</strong>: The socket is assigned a form using
    <code>Locations.change_location/1</code>, which generates a changeset for
    handling location updates, including the selected location and any images
    being uploaded. The form tracks both the location data and file uploads,
    ensuring that when the form is submitted, both the location and the
    associated images are updated together. Additionally,
    <code>stream/2</code> is used to manage the list of locations in real-time,
    allowing any updates to the locations (including image uploads) to be
    reflected instantly in the UI without requiring a page refresh.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enabling File Uploads</strong>:
    <code>allow_upload/3</code> configures the file upload process for
    <code>:photos</code>, accepting <code>.png</code> and
    <code>.jpg</code> files, with a limit of 8 files and a maximum size of 10
    MB.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  The <code>render/1</code> function generates the HTML structure for the page,
  including the file upload interface and the display of uploaded images:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Location Selection</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A dropdown menu allows users to select a location (city) from a list of
        Estonian cities.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>File Upload and Preview Components</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>&lt;.uploads_upload_area /&gt;</code></strong
        >: Handles the drag-and-drop area and file selection interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>&lt;.uploads_photo_preview_area /&gt;</code></strong
        >: Manages the display of file previews, showing thumbnails for accepted
        files and errors for rejected ones.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>General Error Display</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Before the file previews are rendered, any general errors related to the
        file uploads, such as exceeding the maximum number of files, are
        displayed using the <code>&lt;.error&gt;</code> component.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Uploaded Files Display</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A table displays the locations along with any associated images:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Location Name</strong>: Shows the name of the location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thumbnails</strong>: Displays thumbnails of the uploaded
            images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remove Images</strong>: Provides a link to delete all images
            associated with a location. This operation removes only the images,
            leaving the location intact.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function handles user interactions related to file uploads, form
  submission, and image management:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"cancel" Event</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Triggered when a user clicks the trash icon next to an uploading file.
        This event removes the file from the upload queue using
        <code>cancel_upload/3</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"validate" Event</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Validates the form as the user interacts with it, ensuring that the file
        upload UI functions correctly and that the selected files meet the
        validation criteria.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"save" Event</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This event is triggered when the user submits the form to upload images
        for the selected location:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Retrieve Location</strong>: The
            <code>location_id</code> from the form is used to fetch the selected
            location from the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consume Uploads</strong>: The
            <code>consume_uploaded_entries/3</code> function processes each
            uploaded image after it has been uploaded to a
            <strong>temporary location</strong> on the server, managed by
            Phoenix LiveView. This temporary file path is provided in the
            <code>meta.path</code> field.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Once the file is confirmed as uploaded, LiveView automatically
                triggers <code>consume_uploaded_entries/3</code>. The function
                copies the file from the temporary location to a permanent
                storage directory on the server, ensuring the image is saved and
                accessible.
              </li>
              <li>
                The function returns a list of filenames of the uploaded images,
                which are then used to update the location's record in the
                database.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Update Location</strong>: The new image paths are added to
            the photos attribute, which is stored as a list of strings in the
            database (<code>field :photos, {:array, :string}, default: []</code
            >). This allows each location to have multiple associated images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cleanup</strong>: If the update is successful, the old
            photos associated with the location are removed from the server
            using <code>remove_photos/1</code>. This cleanup ensures that only
            the newly uploaded images remain associated with the location. If
            there's an error, the form is re-rendered with the appropriate error
            messages using <code>assign_form/2</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"remove_images" Event</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Triggered when the user clicks "Remove Images" next to a location in the
        table:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Retrieve Location</strong>: The <code>location_id</code> is
            used to fetch the selected location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Images</strong>: The <code>photos</code> attribute is
            set to an empty list, and the location is updated in the database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cleanup</strong>: The associated images are removed from the
            server using <code>remove_photos/1</code>. If there's an error, the
            form is re-rendered with the appropriate error messages using
            <code>assign_form/2</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  The <code>handle_info/2</code> function is used to handle messages broadcasted
  to the LiveView process. In this module, it specifically handles updates to
  location data that have been broadcasted using Phoenix PubSub:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Purpose</strong>: When a location is updated (for example, when
      new images are uploaded or existing ones are removed), this update is
      broadcasted to all connected clients. The
      <code>handle_info/2</code> function ensures that each client's view is
      updated in real-time to reflect these changes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Functionality</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The function pattern matches on the
        <code>{:update_location, location}</code> message, which contains the
        updated location data.
      </li>
      <li>
        It then uses <code>stream_insert/3</code> to insert the updated location
        into the <code>:locations</code> stream within the socket.
      </li>
      <li>
        This real-time update ensures that all connected users immediately see
        the changes to the location in the UI without needing to refresh the
        page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<p>
  These private helper functions assist in processing uploads and managing form
  state:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>assign_form/2</code></strong
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Updates the form in the socket with the given changeset, allowing the
        form to reflect the latest validation state and errors.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>filename/1</code></strong
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Generates a unique filename for each uploaded image by combining the
        entryâ€™s UUID with the original client name, ensuring that files do not
        overwrite each other on the server.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>remove_photos/1</code></strong
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Deletes the specified photos from the server. This function is called
        both when updating a location with new images and when removing images
        entirely, ensuring that the server's file system is kept in sync with
        the database.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Backend Logic and Broadcasting</h3>
<p>
  After successfully updating the database, it broadcasts the change to all
  connected clients using Phoenix PubSub. The
  <code>handle_info/2</code> function listens for these broadcast messages.
</p>
<h3>Static Paths Configuration</h3>
<p>
  To ensure that uploaded images are correctly served by the Phoenix server, you
  need to add the "uploads" directory to the list of static paths:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>lib/live_playground_web.ex</code></strong
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <code>static_paths/0</code> function defines which directories
        Phoenix will serve static files from. By adding <code>uploads</code> to
        this list, you ensure that any files stored in the
        <code>uploads</code> directory are accessible via the web. If you fail
        to add <code>uploads</code> here, the images won't be served to the
        client, meaning that the uploaded images won't display in the browser.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>config/dev.exs</code></strong
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The live reload configuration specifies which files and directories
        should trigger a live reload when changed. The regex pattern
        <code>~r"priv/static/(?!uploads).*(js|css|png|jpeg|jpg|gif|svg)$"</code>
        excludes the <code>uploads</code> directory from triggering a live
        reload when files within it are changed. This is intentional because
        uploaded files might change frequently, and you typically don't want
        every image upload to trigger a full live reload. However, ensuring the
        <code>uploads</code> directory is listed in
        <code>static_paths/0</code> guarantees that these files are served
        properly even without triggering live reloads.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
