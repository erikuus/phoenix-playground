<p>
  The <code>SendAfter</code> module is designed to automatically refresh and
  display server statistics at regular intervals. Here's a detailed look at its
  components and functionality:
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>Invoked when the LiveView is mounted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It checks if the socket is connected using <code>connected?(socket)</code>.
    This prevents scheduling the <code>:refresh</code> message during initial
    server-side rendering, where updates wouldn't reach the client anyway. This
    optimization reduces server load and prevents unnecessary message scheduling
    during static page generation.
  </li>
  <li>
    It schedules a <code>:refresh</code> message to be sent to itself after
    <code>@refresh_interval</code> milliseconds (in this case, 2000 ms or 2
    seconds) using <code>Process.send_after/3</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>assign_stats/1</code> helper function is called to fetch and
    assign the initial server statistics to the socket's assigns.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>This function renders the assigned server statistics within the template:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It uses a custom component <code>.stats</code> that defines a layout for the
    statistics dashboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Within this component, it uses the <code>&lt;:card&gt;</code> subcomponent
    to display each server metric. The <code>title</code> attribute provides a
    label for each card, and the corresponding statistic is rendered within it.
  </li>
  <li>
    The three metrics displayed are:
    <strong>Active Connections</strong> (current server load),
    <strong>Requests/sec</strong> (throughput), and
    <strong>Response Time (ms)</strong> (performance).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles the <code>:refresh</code> message and creates a self-sustaining
  refresh cycle:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When a <code>:refresh</code> message is received (which happens every 2
    seconds), it calls the <code>assign_stats/1</code> function again to update
    the server statistics in the assigns with the latest data.
  </li>
  <li>
    It then schedules another <code>:refresh</code> message using
    <code>Process.send_after/3</code> to continue the cycle. This creates a
    self-sustaining loop where each refresh automatically schedules the next
    one.
  </li>
  <li>
    The cycle continues until the LiveView process terminates (when the user
    navigates away or closes the browser), at which point the scheduled messages
    are automatically cleaned up.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Function</h3>
<h4><code>assign_stats/1</code></h4>
<p>
  This helper function fetches the latest server statistics by calling functions
  from the <code>Stats</code> context/module:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>Stats.active_connections()</code> to get the current number of active
    connections.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Stats.requests_per_second()</code> to get the current request
    throughput.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Stats.response_time_ms()</code> to get the current average response
    time in milliseconds.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The fetched statistics are assigned to the socket, ready to be used in the
  render function. This realistic server monitoring data demonstrates how
  interval-based updates are particularly valuable for system monitoring
  dashboards.
</p>
<h3>Processes in Phoenix LiveView</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When a LiveView is instantiated, it runs within its own Elixir process. This
    is a separate lightweight thread of execution that maintains the LiveView's
    state and handles events.
  </li>
  <li>
    This process starts when the LiveView is mounted via the
    <code>mount/3</code> function and continues to exist until the user's
    session ends, for example, by navigating away from the page or closing the
    browser, at which point the process is terminated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Process.send_after/4</code> is used to schedule a message (<code
      >:refresh</code
    >
    in this case) to be sent to the process after a set amount of time
    (<code>@refresh_interval</code>). This is an asynchronous action; the
    process continues to execute other work, such as rendering templates or
    handling user interactions, without blocking or waiting for this time to
    elapse.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Timer Pattern: <code>send_after</code> vs <code>send_interval</code></h3>
<p>
  This module uses <code>Process.send_after/3</code> instead of
  <code>Process.send_interval/3</code>
  for periodic updates. Here's why:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>send_after</strong>: Sends a single message after a delay, creating
    a self-sustaining cycle where each message handler schedules the next
    message.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>send_interval</strong>: Automatically sends repeated messages at
    fixed intervals, but requires manual timer cancellation in
    <code>terminate/2</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>send_after</code> pattern is simpler because it doesn't require
    explicit cleanup - when the process terminates, any pending messages are
    automatically discarded.
  </li>
</ul>
