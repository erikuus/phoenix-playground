<p>
  The <code>Upload</code> module demonstrates how to create file upload controls
  and previews in Phoenix LiveView. This example focuses on building a user
  interface for image uploads, including a drag-and-drop area, file selection
  link, and real-time previews that depend on whether the file was accepted
  based on type and size. No actual file upload process occurs in this
  module—only the user interface for managing file selection and validation is
  implemented.

<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function initializes the LiveView and sets up the socket for handling
  file uploads:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Form Initialization</strong>: The socket is assigned a form using
    <code>Locations.change_location/1</code>, which creates a changeset for a
    new <code>Location</code> struct. This form is essential for managing the
    state of the file inputs and handling validation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enabling File Uploads</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>allow_upload/3</code> is used to configure the file upload for
        <code>:photos</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It accepts files with <code>.png</code> and
        <code>.jpg</code> extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limits the number of files to 4 and sets a maximum file size of 10 MB.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  Defines the HTML structure sent to the client, including the necessary form
  setup and file upload UI:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Form Setup</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The file upload interface is wrapped inside a
        <code>&lt;.form&gt;</code> element. In Phoenix LiveView, the
        <code>allow_upload/3</code> function and file upload features require
        this form element to function correctly. The form manages the state of
        file inputs, handles uploads, and generates previews.
      </li>
      <li>
        The form includes a text input field for the
        <code>name</code> attribute. In Phoenix LiveView, having at least one
        non-file input field within the form is necessary for the file upload
        mechanism to operate correctly. This is because the form’s lifecycle and
        state management are closely tied to these inputs. Without form
        validation, the upload controls and previews would not be functional.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>File Upload UI</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The drag-and-drop area is created using the
        <code>phx-drop-target</code> attribute, which is linked to
        <code>@uploads.photos.ref</code>. This allows users to drag and drop
        files or use the file selection link to choose files.
      </li>
      <li>
        The allowed file types (<code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>), the
        maximum number of files (4), and the maximum file size (10 MB) are
        displayed dynamically using helper functions like
        <code>format_accept/1</code> and <code>format_max_file_size/1</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>General Error Display</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Before the file previews are rendered, any general errors related to the
        file uploads, such as exceeding the maximum number of files, are
        displayed using the <code>&lt;.error&gt;</code> component.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>File Previews</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Accepted Files</strong>: If a file is accepted (correct type and
        within size limits), a thumbnail preview is displayed. A progress ring
        shows the upload progress, and once completed, the progress indicator is
        removed. The trash icon allows the user to remove the file from the
        upload queue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rejected Files</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Wrong File Type</strong>: If the file is of an incorrect
            type (e.g., not <code>.png</code> or <code>.jpg</code>), the file
            name is displayed instead of a thumbnail, with an error message
            indicating that the file was not accepted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Other Errors (e.g., Too Large)</strong>: If the file is
            rejected for other reasons, such as exceeding the maximum size, an
            error message is displayed instead of the progress circle.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In all cases, the trash bin icon is present, allowing the user to remove
        the file from the upload list regardless of the error type.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>Manages user interactions with the file upload UI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"cancel"</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Triggered when the user clicks the cancel icon (trash icon) on an
        uploaded file preview.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>cancel_upload/3</code> function is called to remove the file
        from the upload queue based on its reference (<code>ref</code>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"validate"</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Triggered when the form is changed, such as when the user types in the
        name field.
      </li>
      <li>
        A changeset is created using the updated form data
        (<code>params</code>), and validation is applied.
      </li>
      <li>
        The form is then re-assigned to the socket with the updated changeset,
        allowing for real-time validation feedback. This validation process is
        essential for the upload preview and validation to work correctly within
        the LiveView form.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<p>These functions support the formatting and display of the file upload UI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>format_accept/1</code></strong
    >: Converts the accepted file types into a readable string (e.g.,
    <code>.png, .jpg</code> becomes <code>PNG, JPG</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>format_max_file_size/1</code></strong
    >: Converts the maximum file size from bytes to megabytes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_circumference/1</code></strong
    >: Calculates the circumference of the progress ring used to visualize
    upload progress.
  </li>
</ul>
