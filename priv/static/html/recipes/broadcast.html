<p>
  The <code>Broadcast</code> module demonstrates real-time updates using Phoenix
  PubSub. When one user updates country data, all other connected users see the
  changes immediately. This pattern is essential for collaborative applications
  where multiple users work with shared data.
</p>

<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Sets up the LiveView session by subscribing to updates for a specific country
  (ID 228) and loading initial data. The subscription only happens if the socket
  is connected, which prevents unnecessary subscriptions during server-side
  pre-rendering.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Uses <code>Countries.subscribe(@country_id)</code> to create a
    topic-specific subscription. The topic name is constructed in the Countries
    context module as <code>"country:#{country_id}"</code> (e.g.,
    <code>"country:228"</code>), which you can see in the code below. This
    targeted approach means LiveView processes only receive broadcasts for the
    specific country they're displaying, rather than all country updates. This
    is crucial for performance in applications with many countries and users.
  </li>
  <li>
    The pattern <code>"resource:id"</code> (e.g., <code>"country:228"</code>) is
    a Phoenix convention that allows granular subscriptions. Alternative
    approaches include global topics like <code>"countries"</code> (all country
    updates) or user-specific topics like <code>"user:123"</code> (user's
    subscriptions only).
  </li>
  <li>
    Uses <code>Countries.get_country!(@country_id)</code> which lets Phoenix
    automatically handle "not found" errors with appropriate HTTP responses,
    following the convention for functions ending with <code>!</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>terminate/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Cleans up the PubSub subscription when the LiveView session ends using
  <code>Countries.unsubscribe(@country_id)</code>. Without this cleanup, the
  PubSub registry would maintain a reference to the dead LiveView process,
  causing broadcast messages to be sent to non-existent processes. This creates
  memory leaks in the PubSub registry and wasted CPU cycles attempting to
  deliver messages to dead processes. The unsubscription uses the same
  country-specific topic that was created during <code>mount/3</code>.
</p>

<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>
  Displays a simple form for editing the head of state field, followed by a
  read-only list of country details. The form is always visible, making it easy
  for users to make changes that will be broadcast to other connected users
  viewing the same country.
</p>

<h3><code>get_country_form/1</code></h3>
<p>
  Helper function that creates a form for the country data. It generates a fresh
  changeset and converts it to a form, ensuring the input always shows the
  current value even when updated via broadcasts from other users.
</p>

<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>Processes form submissions to update the country's head of state.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Success Path</strong>: Updates the country data locally and shows
    "Head of state updated successfully." The broadcast to other users is
    handled automatically by the
    <code>Countries.update_country_broadcast/2</code> function, which targets
    the same <code>"country:228"</code> topic that other LiveView processes are
    subscribed to.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Error Path</strong>: Converts validation errors to a form and
    re-renders, allowing users to see and fix validation problems without losing
    their input.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles broadcast messages when other users update the country data. This
  function processes updates and provides user feedback when meaningful changes
  occur.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Uses <code>country_changed?/2</code> to check if the update contains actual
    changes to important fields (headofstate, population, gnp, lifeexpectancy).
  </li>
  <li>
    Shows "Country data updated by another user." only when data actually
    changes, preventing notification spam from redundant updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Always updates the country data to maintain consistency, even if no visible
    changes occurred.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>country_changed?/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Helper function that compares the current country data with updated data to
  determine if any meaningful changes occurred. This prevents unnecessary flash
  messages when broadcasts contain identical data.
</p>

<h3>PubSub Implementation Details</h3>
<p>
  The broadcast functionality is implemented in the
  <code>Countries</code> context module. Understanding the subscription and
  broadcast topic matching is crucial for proper implementation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Topic Consistency</strong><br />The subscription topic
    <code>"country:#{country_id}"</code> in
    <code>Countries.subscribe/1</code> must exactly match the broadcast topic in
    <code>Countries.broadcast/2</code>. This ensures messages reach the correct
    subscribers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Preventing Self-Broadcasts</strong><br />
    Uses <code>Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast_from/4</code> with
    <code>self()</code> to prevent the originating process from receiving its
    own broadcast message, avoiding redundant updates. The alternative
    <code>Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast/3</code> would send to ALL processes
    including the sender.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Message Format</strong><br />
    Broadcasts messages as
    <code>{__MODULE__, {:update_country, updated_country}}</code> tuples that
    LiveView processes can handle in their <code>handle_info/2</code> functions.
    This follows the Phoenix convention of including the module name to prevent
    message conflicts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scalability Considerations</strong><br />
    Using country-specific topics scales better than global topics because each
    LiveView only receives relevant updates. In a system with 1000 countries and
    10000 users, a user viewing one country doesn't receive 9999 irrelevant
    broadcasts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternative PubSub Patterns</h3>
<p>
  While this example uses resource-specific topics, other patterns exist
  depending on your application's needs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Global Topics</strong><br />
    <code>"countries"</code> - All LiveViews receive all country updates. Simple
    but doesn't scale well.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User-Specific Topics</strong><br />
    <code>"user:#{user_id}"</code> - Each user has their own topic for
    personalized updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hierarchical Topics</strong><br />
    <code>"region:europe:country:228"</code> - Allows subscribing to different
    levels of granularity.
  </li>
</ul>
