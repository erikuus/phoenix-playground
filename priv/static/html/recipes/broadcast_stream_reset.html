<p>
  The <code>BroadcastStreamReset</code> module demonstrates the powerful
  combination of Phoenix LiveViewâ€™s streaming capabilities with Phoenix PubSub
  for real-time data synchronization and navigation management.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code> and <code>init_tab/4</code></h3>
<p>
  These functions initialize the LiveView session based on whether a
  <code>country_id</code> is present:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>With <code>country_id</code></strong
    >: Attempts to fetch the specified country and its cities. If the country
    doesn't exist (caught by <code>Ecto.NoResultsError</code>), it initializes
    the view with empty data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Without <code>country_id</code></strong
    >: Automatically selects the first country from a list of Baltic countries
    and displays its cities. If no countries are found, it initializes with no
    data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Setting up the stream in <code>mount/3</code> ensures the data stream is
  configured from the start, enabling efficient data handling and avoiding the
  overhead of reconfiguring streams during parameter handling.
</p>
<h3><code>terminate/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Ensures cleanup by unsubscribing from city updates when the LiveView session
  ends. This step prevents memory leaks and conserves resources.
</p>
<h3>
  <code>handle_params/2</code>, <code>change_tab/2</code>,
  <code>apply_action/2</code>
</h3>
<p>These functions manage navigation and actions based on URL parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Stream Reset on Tab Change</strong>: If the selected country changes
    (detected by comparing <code>selected_country</code> in the socket assigns),
    it resets the city stream (<code>stream(:cities, ..., reset: true)</code>)
    to reload city data for the new country, efficiently clearing previous
    entries and avoiding memory leaks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Index Action</strong>: Uses the <code>set_form/3</code> helper to
    prepare the form for adding a new city.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edit Action</strong>: Fetches an existing city based on its ID. Uses
    the <code>set_form/3</code> helper to prepare the form for editing. If the
    city does not exist, it redirects to the index action.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>Defines the HTML output, which includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Conditional Alerts for Data Absence</strong>: Displays alerts if
    there are no countries or cities available, handling potentially empty
    states that can result from direct URL manipulation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic Tabs for Countries</strong>: Allows users to switch between
    different countries, dynamically reloading the city list for the selected
    country.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Form Interaction</strong>: Supports both creation and editing of
    city details, adjusting dynamically based on user actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Table Display</strong>: Streams current city data, incorporating
    real-time updates and deletions directly within the UI. Each table entry
    includes a timestamp, showing when the city was last updated or inserted
    into the stream.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>Handles various user actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"delete"</strong>: Deletes a city and broadcasts this change using
    PubSub, which updates all connected clients immediately to reflect the
    change and maintain consistency.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"validate"</strong>: Provides real-time validation for form inputs,
    helping users correct errors before submission.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"save"</strong>: Uses the <code>save_city/3</code> helper to handle
    form submissions for adding or updating cities. It makes use of PubSub
    broadcasting implemented in the <code>Cities</code> module to notify all
    connected clients of changes.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Optimistic Locking</strong>: Checks the
        <code>lock_version</code> field to ensure the city data has not been
        modified by another user since it was last fetched. If a version
        conflict is detected, it informs the user via a flash message and
        prevents data overwrite, maintaining data integrity.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles broadcast messages for city creation, updates, and deletions.
  Broadcasting, implemented in the <code>Cities</code> module, pushes these
  changes to all subscribed clients in real time, ensuring all views are
  immediately updated to reflect the latest data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Creation and Updates</strong>: Inserts or updates city data in the
    stream, ensuring real-time synchronization across all clients. If the city
    being edited is updated by another user, it notifies the current user of the
    change.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Deletion</strong>: Removes the city from the stream, reflecting the
    change across all client views immediately.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>assign_form/2</code></strong
    >: Assigns a changeset to the socket as a form. This involves converting the
    changeset into a form-friendly structure using <code>to_form/1</code> and
    then assigning it to the <code>:form</code> key in the socket's assigns,
    making it ready for rendering in the form.
  </li>
</ul>
