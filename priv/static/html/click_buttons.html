<p>This module is an excellent starting point for understanding event handling in an interactive web application with LiveView. The key functionality is to update the displayed country details based on the user's selection, without a full page reload.</p>
<h3>Key Components and Functions</h3>
<h4><code>mount/3</code></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Initializes the LiveView instance.</li>
    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This function sets up the initial state of the LiveView by loading a list of countries from a predefined region ("Baltic Countries"). It uses pattern matching to handle different outcomes from the <code>Countries.list_region_country/1</code> function:<ul>
            <li>If no countries are found, it sets the <code>countries</code> list to empty and <code>selected_country</code> to <code>nil</code>.</li>
            <li>If countries are found, it assigns the first country in the list as the selected country.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4><code>render/1</code></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Renders the HTML content for the LiveView.</li>
    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This function creates a set of button links for each country in the <code>@countries</code> list. These buttons have an event handler (<code>phx-click</code>) assigned to trigger on click events, sending "select-country" along with the country's ID (<code>phx-value-id</code>). It uses a helper function <code>get_button_kind/2</code> to style the button based on whether it's the selected country.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Content</strong>: Below the buttons, the <code>country_details/1</code> function is called to render details of the selected country, or a message if no countries are available.</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>handle_event/3</code></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Handles events triggered by user interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: When a button is clicked, this function is triggered with the event name "select-country" and the ID of the selected country. It then retrieves the full details of this country and updates the <code>selected_country</code> in the <code>socket</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Response</strong>: It returns <code>{:noreply, socket}</code>, indicating that the state has been updated but no immediate reply is required.</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>get_button_kind/2</code></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Determines the styling of the button based on whether the country is currently selected.</li>
    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: Returns <code>:primary</code> if the button represents the selected country, otherwise <code>:secondary</code>. This helps visually indicate which country is currently active.</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>country_details/1</code></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Renders detailed information about the selected country.</li>
    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: It checks if there is a selected country and displays its details, including code, continent, population, etc. If no country is selected, it displays an alert message.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Concepts Illustrated</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Event Handling</strong>: <code>phx-click</code> is used to manage user interactions, specifically button clicks here. It links the front end to the server-side Elixir logic seamlessly.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic State Management</strong>: The <code>assign/3</code> function updates the LiveView's state (<code>socket</code>), crucial for changing what the user sees without reloading the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditional Rendering</strong>: The rendering of components changes based on the state, such as which country is selected or whether any countries are available.</li>
    <li><strong>Component Reuse</strong>: Functions like <code>country_details/1</code> encapsulate rendering logic that can be reused, keeping the <code>render/1</code> function clean and focused.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This module exemplifies how Phoenix LiveView can be used to create interactive, real-time web applications. By handling events like button clicks within the Elixir environment, developers can maintain rich client-side interactions while leveraging server-side efficiencies.</p>
