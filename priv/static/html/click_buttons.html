<p>This LiveView module, <code>ClickButtons</code>, is focused on handling button click events to display information about countries within the "Baltic Countries" region. Here's what the code does:</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>In the <code>mount/3</code> function, a list of countries in the "Baltic Countries" region is fetched. If the list is empty, both <code>:countries</code> and <code>:selected_country</code> are set to <code>nil</code> in the socket's assigns. If there are countries, the first one is set as the <code>:selected_country</code>, and the list is saved under <code>:countries</code>.</p>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>In the <code>render/1</code> function, button links are generated for each country. These buttons have a <code>phx-click</code> attribute set to "select-country", which means that clicking the button will trigger the <code>handle_event/3</code> function with the corresponding event. The <code>phx-value-id</code> attribute holds the country's ID, which is used to identify which country was selected. The button's style is determined by the <code>get_button_kind/2</code> function based on whether it is the selected country.</p>
<h3><code>country_details/1</code></h3>
<p>This helper function renders the details of the selected country. It's designed to handle two scenarios:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If <code>:selected_country</code> is <code>nil</code>, an alert is shown to inform that no countries were found in the specified region.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, it renders a list of the selected country's details, such as code, continent, region, year of independence, form of government, head of state, population (formatted with a delimiter), GNP, and life expectancy.</li>
</ol>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This function captures click events on the buttons, specifically the "select-country" event, which is sent when any of the buttons are clicked. When a button is clicked, it receives the country ID from <code>phx-value-id</code> and uses it to fetch the corresponding country's details with <code>Countries.get_country!/1</code>. It then updates the <code>:selected_country</code> assign with the fetched country.</p>
<h3><code>get_button_kind/2</code></h3>
<p>A simple utility function used within the <code>render/1</code> function to determine the styling of the buttons. It compares the <code>country</code> against the <code>selected_country</code>. If they match, it returns <code>:primary</code> which signifies that the button should have a primary styling. If they do not match, it returns <code>:secondary</code>, suggesting a more subdued styling.</p>
<p>This module is a prime example of handling user interaction within Phoenix LiveView, using events to update the state of the LiveView, and conditionally rendering UI elements based on that state. It shows how to update and manage the LiveView's internal state in response to user actions, which is central to creating interactive applications with LiveView.</p>
