<p>The <code>StreamUpdate</code> module is designed to minimize server load by using LiveView's streaming capabilities, which let us update large collections without hefty memory overhead.</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>Initializes the LiveView, setting up a stream to deliver city data from the "EST" locale to the client, which allows for real-time updates without full page reloads.</p>
<h3><code>handle_params/2</code> and <code>apply_action/2</code></h3>
<p>These functions work together to route user interactions based on URL parameters, enhancing the module's responsiveness to user actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>handle_params/2</code></strong>: Extracts parameters from the URL and delegates action handling based on these parameters, using <code>apply_action/2</code>.</li>
    <li><strong><code>apply_action/2</code></strong>: Differentiates actions such as viewing the main index or editing a specific city:<ul>
            <li>For the <code>:edit</code> action, it retrieves the city by ID, sets up an edit form populated with the city's data, and updates the socket's assigns for rendering.</li>
            <li>For the <code>:index</code> action, it simply maintains the current state without modifications. This centralization of action handling based on parameters simplifies routing logic and enhances maintainability.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>Defines the HTML output, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conditional Form Display</strong>: Shows an edit form if <code>live_action</code> is set to <code>:edit</code>, with fields for name, district, and population. These fields are debounced to optimize input handling.</li>
    <li><strong>City List Display</strong>: Streams city data into a dynamically updated table.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit and Cancel Actions</strong>: Provides dynamic links for editing each city, adjusting the URL to include city-specific parameters, and a cancel button to revert back to the main view.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Feedback</strong>: Timestamps within each city row visually demonstrate that only the affected parts of the LiveView are updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code> for "save"</h3>
<p>Handles updates submitted via the edit form:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Success</strong>: Inserts the updated city back into the stream and redirects to the main view with a success message, confirming the city was updated.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure</strong>: Reloads the form with validation errors and displays an error message to inform the user of the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>get_city_form/1</code></strong>: Converts a <code>City</code> struct into a form changeset. This involves creating a changeset for the city using <code>Cities.change_city/1</code> and then converting that changeset into a form-friendly structure with <code>to_form/1</code>. This is used to prepare the form for editing city details.</li>
</ul>
