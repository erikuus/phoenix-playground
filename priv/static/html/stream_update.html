<p>The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.RecipesLive.StreamUpdate</code> module uses Phoenix LiveView to handle city data updates dynamically. It's designed to minimize server load by using LiveView's streaming capabilities, which let us update large collections without hefty memory overhead.</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>Initializes the LiveView, setting up a stream to deliver city data from the "EST" locale to the client, which allows for real-time updates without full page reloads.</p>
<h3><code>handle_params/2</code> and <code>apply_action/2</code></h3>
<p>These functions work together to route user interactions based on URL parameters, enhancing the module's responsiveness to user actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>handle_params/2</code></strong>: Extracts parameters from the URL and delegates action handling based on these parameters, using <code>apply_action/2</code>.</li>
    <li><strong><code>apply_action/2</code></strong>: Differentiates actions such as viewing the main index or editing a specific city:<ul>
            <li>For the <code>:edit</code> action, it retrieves the city by ID, sets up an edit form populated with the city's data, and updates the socket's assigns for rendering.</li>
            <li>For the <code>:index</code> action, it simply maintains the current state without modifications. This centralization of action handling based on parameters simplifies routing logic and enhances maintainability.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>Defines the HTML output, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conditional Form Display</strong>: Shows an edit form if <code>live_action</code> is set to <code>:edit</code>, with fields for name, district, and population. These fields are debounced to optimize input handling.</li>
    <li><strong>City List Display</strong>: Streams city data into a dynamically updated table.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit and Cancel Actions</strong>: Provides dynamic links for editing each city, adjusting the URL to include city-specific parameters, and a cancel button to revert back to the main view.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Feedback</strong>: Timestamps within each city row visually demonstrate that only the affected parts of the LiveView are updated, enhancing the user's perception of real-time interaction without unnecessary page refreshes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code> for "save"</h3>
<p>Handles updates submitted via the edit form:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Success</strong>: Inserts the updated city back into the stream and redirects to the main view with a success message, confirming the city was updated.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure</strong>: Reloads the form with validation errors and displays an error message to inform the user of the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.RecipesLive.StreamUpdate</code> module demonstrates how to update items in large collections efficiently using Phoenix LiveView's streams. This approach keeps server-side memory usage low and ensures that user interactions are responsive and smooth.</p>
