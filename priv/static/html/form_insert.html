<p>
  The <code>FormInsert</code> module is designed for inserting new city records
  into a database. It combines form handling and dynamic updates to display new
  entries immediately upon submission. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the key
  components and functionalities:
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function initializes the LiveView by loading a list of cities from a
  specified country ("EST") using <code>Cities.list_country_city("EST")</code>.
  It also sets up an empty form for new city entries using
  <code>get_empty_form()</code>, which prepares a new <code>City</code> struct
  with initial values and assigns both the list of cities and the form to the
  socket.
</p>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>The rendering function constructs the HTML:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A form for city data submission, configured to handle the "save" event. It
    includes input fields for the city's name, district, and population, along
    with a save button.
  </li>
  <li>
    A dynamic table displays the list of cities. If there are cities available
    (<code>@cities != []</code>), it renders each city's name, district, and
    population. Responsive design elements are included for different viewing
    devices.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code> for "save"</h3>
<p>This event handler processes form submissions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Success Path</strong>: If the city is successfully created
    (<code>Cities.create_city(params)</code>), the new city is added to the top
    of the list in the LiveView's state, the form is reset to an empty state,
    and a flash message is displayed to the user.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Error Path</strong>: If there's an error (typically a validation
    failure), the changeset is converted back to form state to display
    validation errors and the form is re-rendered with the user's input and
    corresponding error messages.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_empty_form/0</code></strong
    >: Prepares an empty form by initializing a <code>City</code> struct and
    transforming it into a form-compatible format using
    <code>Cities.change_city()</code> and <code>to_form()</code>. This function
    is used to reset the form after a successful submission or to initialize the
    form when the LiveView mounts.
  </li>
</ul>
