<h3>
  <strong>General Principles</strong>
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Keeping Key Items Always in View</strong><br />Newly added,
      edited, or deleted items remain visible in the current view, even if they
      don't naturally belong to the page based on sorting or pagination. This
      ensures users always see immediate feedback for their actions. Deleted
      items are not removed abruptly but marked visually until the user
      navigates away or refreshes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handling Simultaneous User Actions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If another user modifies a language after you have opened the edit form,
        saving your changes will display an error:
        <strong
          >“This {item} has been modified. We've loaded the latest version.
          Please review and submit again.”</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        If another user deletes a language while you are editing it, the edit
        modal will close automatically, and a flash message will notify you:
        <strong
          >“The {item} you were editing was deleted by another user.”</strong
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Additions</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When a new item is added, it is temporarily placed at the top of the list,
    regardless of its actual sorted position.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new item is highlighted with a green background and a
    <strong>“New” badge</strong>. These indicators remain until the user
    navigates away, refreshes, or reloads the page to sort the item into its
    correct position.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user who adds the item sees:
    <strong
      >“{Item} created successfully. It has been temporarily added to the top of
      the list and will be sorted to its correct position on the next page load.
      <u>Click here to reload and sort now</u>.”</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users see:
    <strong
      >“A new {item} was added by another user. It has been temporarily added to
      the top of the list and will be sorted to its correct position on the next
      page load. <u>Click here to reload and sort now</u>.”</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Edits</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Edited items are updated in place and remain in their current position until
    reset or navigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edited items are highlighted with a blue background and marked with an
    <strong>“Edited” badge</strong> for easy identification.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user who edits the item sees:
    <strong
      >“{Item} updated successfully.
      <u>Click here to reload and sort now</u>.”</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users see (only if the item is visible on their current page):
    <strong
      >"An {item} has been updated by another user.
      <u>Click here to reload and sort now</u>."</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Deletions</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Deleted items remain visible but are marked with a gray background, a
    strikethrough, and a <strong>“Deleted” badge</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Items are only fully removed when the user navigates away or refreshes the
    page.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user who deletes the item sees:
    <strong
      >“{Item} deleted. It will be removed from the list when you navigate away
      or refresh. <u>Click here to reload and sort now</u>.”</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users see (only if the item is visible on their current page):
    <strong
      >"An {item} has been deleted by another user.
      <u>Click here to reload and sort now</u>."</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>
  The summary (e.g., "1 - 6 of 101") reflects the visible rows and total count.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>After an Addition</strong>: The summary updates immediately to
      reflect the new total count but adjusts after a refresh to reflect the
      correct sorted position of the new item. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before addition: <strong>“1 - 5 of 100”</strong></li>
      <li>After addition: <strong>“1 - 6 of 101”</strong></li>
      <li>After refresh: <strong>“1 - 5 of 101”</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>After a Deletion</strong>: The summary remains gray to indicate
      that it is temporarily out of sync with the actual total until a refresh
      or navigation resolves it. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before deletion: <strong>“1 - 5 of 100”</strong></li>
      <li>After deletion: <strong>“1 - 5 of 100”</strong> (with gray text)</li>
      <li>After refresh: <strong>“1 - 5 of 99”</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Pagination</strong></h3>
<p>
  The pagination reflects the total number of pages based on the number of items
  and items per page. Updates occur after a refresh or navigation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>After an Addition</strong>:<br />The pagination does not change
      immediately but adjusts after a refresh if the total number of pages
      increases due to the addition.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Before addition</strong>: 100 items in 5 pages (20 items per
        page).
      </li>
      <li><strong>After addition</strong>: Pagination still shows 5 pages.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>After refresh</strong>: 101 items in 6 pages (20 items per
        page).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is because the new item fits into the existing pages by temporarily
      displaying 21 items on the current page (1-21), keeping all items within
      the original 5 pages. The 6th page only appears when the user resorts the
      list or navigates away and returns.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>After a Deletion</strong>:<br />The pagination does not change
      immediately but adjusts after a refresh if the total number of pages
      decreases due to the deletion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Before deletion</strong>: 101 items in 6 pages (20 items per
        page).
      </li>
      <li><strong>After deletion</strong>: Pagination still shows 6 pages.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>After refresh</strong>: 100 items in 5 pages (20 items per
        page).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is because the deleted item is initially just marked for deletion but
      remains visible. The deletion takes effect and the language disappears
      completely when you navigate away or refresh the page.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  This strategy ensures a seamless user experience, balancing real-time
  responsiveness, clarity of feedback, and stability of the interface. It
  accounts for both individual and collaborative actions in a multi-user
  environment.
