<h2>
  <strong>UX Strategy for Pagination and Real-Time Updates</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
  <strong>General Principles</strong>
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Keeping Key Items Always in View</strong><br />Newly added,
      edited, or deleted items remain visible in the current view, even if they
      don’t naturally belong to the page based on sorting or pagination. This
      ensures users always see immediate feedback for their actions, maintaining
      trust and a consistent interface. Deleted items are not removed abruptly
      but marked visually until the user navigates away or refreshes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handling Simultaneous User Actions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If an item is modified by another user after the form is opened, saving
        displays an error:
        <strong>“This language has been modified by someone else.”</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        If an item is being edited, it cannot be deleted by another user.
        Attempting to delete shows the error:
        <strong
          >“Cannot delete language while it is being edited by another
          user.”</strong
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Additions</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When a new item is added, it is temporarily placed at the top of the list,
    regardless of its actual sorted position.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new item is highlighted with a green background and a
    <strong>“New” badge</strong>. These indicators remain until the user
    navigates away, refreshes, or reloads the page to sort the item into its
    correct position.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user who adds the item sees:
    <strong
      >“Item created successfully. It has been temporarily added to the top of
      the list. [Click here to reload and sort now].”</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users see:
    <strong
      >“A new item has been added to the list by another user. [Click here to
      reload and sort now].”</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Edits</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Edited items are updated in place and remain in their current position until
    reset or navigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edited items are highlighted with a blue background and marked with an
    <strong>“Edited” badge</strong> for easy identification.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user who edits the item sees:
    <strong
      >“Item updated successfully. [Click here to reload and sort now].”</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users see:
    <strong
      >“An item has been updated by another user. [Click here to reload and sort
      now].”</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Deletions</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Deleted items remain visible but are marked with a gray background, a
    strikethrough, and a <strong>“Deleted” badge</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Items are only fully removed when the user navigates away or refreshes the
    page.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user who deletes the item sees:
    <strong
      >“Item deleted. It will be removed from the list when you navigate away or
      refresh. [Click here to reload and sort now].”</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users see:
    <strong
      >“An item has been deleted by another user. [Click here to reload and sort
      now].”</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The summary (e.g., "1 - 6 of 101") reflects the visible rows and total
    count.
  </li>
  <li>
    After an addition, the summary updates immediately to reflect the new total
    count. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>Before addition: <strong>“1 - 5 of 100”</strong></li>
      <li>After addition: <strong>“1 - 6 of 101”</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    After a deletion, the summary remains gray to indicate that it is
    temporarily out of sync with the actual total. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>Before deletion: <strong>“1 - 10 of 100”</strong></li>
      <li>After deletion: <strong>“1 - 10 of 100”</strong> (with gray text)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Pagination</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pagination does not immediately reflect changes caused by additions or
    deletions, avoiding disruptive updates during interaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pagination updates only upon navigation or a full page refresh, at which
    point all changes are fully synchronized.
  </li>
  <li>
    Example scenarios:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a new item is added and the total exceeds the current page limit, the
        pagination component remains unchanged until the user navigates or
        refreshes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If all items on the current page are deleted, navigating to the next
        page recalculates and adjusts the pagination to reflect the new total.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  This strategy ensures a seamless user experience, balancing real-time
  responsiveness, clarity of feedback, and stability of the interface. It
  accounts for both individual and collaborative actions in a multi-user
  environment.
