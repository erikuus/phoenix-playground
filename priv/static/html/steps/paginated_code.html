<h2>index.ex</h2>

<p>
  The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.StepsLive.Paginated.Index</code> module is a
  Phoenix LiveView that manages a paginated list of languages. It incorporates
  real-time updates, pagination controls, and concurrency.
</p>

<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Initializes the LiveView when a user visits <code>/steps/paginated</code>,
  handling both scenarios where query parameters are present (e.g.,
  <code>?page=2&per_page=10</code>) and when they are absent. It ensures that
  pagination parameters are correctly parsed, validated, and applied.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the socket is connected, we subscribe to language updates using
    <code>PaginatedLanguages.subscribe()</code>. This allows us to display
    messages when other connected users add, edit, or delete languages. For
    example, if another user adds a new language, you'll see a notification like
    "A new language was added by another user," and the item will appear in your
    list.
  </li>
  <li>
    We assign the total count of languages to the socket using
    <code>PaginatedLanguages.count_languages()</code>. This needs to be done
    before other assigns because we'll need this total count when validating
    pagination parameters to ensure we don't exceed the actual number of pages
    available.
  </li>
  <li>
    We call <code>convert_params/2</code> with the empty options and URL params
    to obtain new pagination options. This function determines the values either
    from the URL params (converting strings like "2" and "20" to integers),
    existing options (already integers), or defaults (page 0 and per_page 0).
    Default and invalid values like "abc" are intentionally converted to 0
    rather than immediately applying valid defaults (page 1 and per_page 10).
    This creates a detectable difference between converted and validated
    options, which triggers URL synchronization when needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    We validate these options using <code>validate_options/2</code>. If the
    validated options differ from the original options, we redirect the user to
    the correct URL using <code>push_navigate</code>. This ensures that the URL
    accurately reflects the validated state, maintaining consistency and
    preventing invalid parameters from affecting the application. For example,
    if someone types page 6 in the URL (like
    <code>/steps/paginated?page=6</code>), but there are only 5 pages available,
    they will be automatically redirected to the last valid page.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the options are valid, we initialize the socket with these options by
    calling the <code>init/2</code> function. This sets up the necessary assigns
    and prepares the socket for rendering the paginated content.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>convert_params/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Converts string parameters from URLs to their appropriate types, preserving
  invalid values as "0" to enable URL correction.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    First clause handles both "page" and "per_page" parameters in the URL:
    <ul>
      <li>Valid numeric strings ("2", "20") are converted to integers</li>
      <li>Invalid strings ("abc", "-5") are converted to 0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Second clause handles only "page" parameter:
    <ul>
      <li>Valid page numbers are converted to integers</li>
      <li>Invalid page values are converted to 0</li>
      <li>per_page is intentionally set to 0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Third clause handles only "per_page" parameter:
    <ul>
      <li>Valid per_page numbers are converted to integers</li>
      <li>Invalid per_page values are converted to 0</li>
      <li>page is intentionally set to 0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fourth clause detects if options already contain valid pagination fields:
    <ul>
      <li>If both page and per_page exist, returns options unchanged</li>
      <li>Used when updating internal state without URL changes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Final clause handles no pagination parameters at all:
    <ul>
      <li>Sets both page and per_page to 0</li>
      <li>Ensures validation will apply correct defaults</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Why we use 0 for invalid inputs:</strong> When convert_params receives
  invalid values, it returns 0 instead of immediately applying defaults. This
  creates a difference between converted and validated options. When validation
  fixes these values, LiveView detects the difference and redirects to fix the
  URL.
</p>

<h3><code>validate_options/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Ensures that <code>page</code> and <code>per_page</code> are within acceptable
  ranges.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It calls <code>get_existing_page/3</code>, which first ensures
    <code>per_page</code> is never zero with <code>max(per_page, 1)</code>. This
    protection is crucial because <code>convert_params</code> may have set
    invalid per_page values to 0. Then it uses <code>ceil_div/2</code> to
    calculate the maximum number of pages. For example, if there are 45 items
    and <code>per_page</code> is set to 10, the function computes 5 pages. If
    someone requests page 6 in the URL, it will automatically adjust to page 5.
  </li>
  <li>
    If <code>per_page</code> is not one of the allowed options, it defaults to
    <code>@per_page</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>init/2</code></h3>
<p>Handles all the initial setup that pagination logic needs.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>:options</code></strong
      >: Stores the current pagination options (<code>page</code> and
      <code>per_page</code>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We maintain three different count variables, each serving a specific
      purpose in our UI:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>:count_all</code> - The real database count</li>
      <li>
        <code>:count_all_summary</code> - What users see in the "Showing X of Y"
        text
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>:count_all_pagination</code> - Used for calculating page numbers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's see why we need all three:</p>
    <p>
      <code>:count_all</code> serves as the definitive count of all language
      items present in the database. It reflects the true state of the data at
      any given moment. Whenever a language is added or deleted,
      <code>:count_all</code> is immediately updated to mirror these changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>:count_all_summary</code> is specifically used for the summary
      display presented to the user, such as "Showing 1 - 5 of 100." The key
      reason for keeping <code>:count_all_summary</code> separate from
      <code>:count_all</code> lies in handling deletions gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>When a user deletes an item:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>:count_all</code></strong> decreases immediately to
        reflect the removal from the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>:count_all_summary</code></strong> remains unchanged
        because the deleted item is still visible on the current page, marked
        appropriately (e.g., with a badge, gray background, and strikethrough).
        This ensures that the summary accurately represents what the user sees.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <code>:count_all_pagination</code> needs to differ from
      <code>:count_all</code> to maintain stable pagination controls. While
      <code>:count_all</code>
      immediately reflects any changes in the total number of items,
      <code>:count_all_pagination</code> deliberately maintains the current page
      structure and only updates during specific user interactionsâ€”such as
      resorting the list, reloading the page, or navigating away.
    </p>
    <p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are 100 items distributed over 5 pages (20 items per page).</li>
      <li>
        After adding an item:
        <ul>
          <li><code>:count_all</code> increases to 101.</li>
          <li>
            <code>:count_all_summary</code> also increases to 101, updating the
            summary to display "Showing 1 - 21 of 101."
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>:count_all_pagination</code> remains at 100 to prevent the
            immediate appearance of a 6th page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is because the new item fits into the existing pages by temporarily
      displaying 21 items on the current page (1-21), keeping all items within
      the original 5 pages. The 6th page only appears when the user resorts the
      list or navigates away. At that point,
      <code>:count_all_pagination</code> is updated to reflect the new total
      count of 101, allowing the pagination to adjust appropriately.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>:visible_ids</code></strong
      >: Stores IDs of items currently visible on the page. This is used to
      optimize broadcasts by only updating the UI when changes affect items that
      are actually visible to the user. For example, if another user updates a
      language that isn't on your current page, your UI won't need to process
      that update.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>:count_visible_rows</code></strong> represents the number of
      items currently visible to the user on the page. This value can exceed the
      <code>per_page</code> limit temporarily when new items are added to the
      current view. For example, if <code>per_page</code> is set to 10 and a new
      item is added, <code>:count_visible_rows</code> becomes 11 to accommodate
      the newly added item. This ensures that the user sees the addition
      immediately without needing to resort or navigate away. Once the user
      resorts the list or moves to another page,
      <code>:count_visible_rows</code> returns to align with the
      <code>per_page</code> value, ensuring consistency in the pagination view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <code>:pending_deletion</code> flag is set to <code>true</code> when
      items are marked as deleted in the UI but have already been removed from
      the database. When this flag is true, the summary section is grayed out to
      indicate that the displayed counts may not accurately reflect the current
      data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Stream Initialization</strong>: We use <code>stream/3</code> to
      set up the initial list of languages. We do this in
      <code>init/2</code> (which is called by <code>mount/3</code>) rather than
      in <code>handle_params/3</code>. This ensures the stream is established
      just once when the LiveView mounts, not every time URL parameters change,
      avoiding unnecessary reloads.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><code>handle_params/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Simply passes the URL parameters to <code>apply_action/3</code>, which handles
  all the view setup based on the current live action.
</p>

<h3><code>apply_action/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Sets up the socket based on the current LiveView action. For all actions, it
  sets an appropriate page title, then:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    For <code>:edit</code>, loads the specific language to be edited from the
    database
  </li>
  <li>
    For <code>:new</code>, initializes an empty language struct to be added
  </li>
  <li>
    For <code>:index</code>, clears any language assigns and calls
    <code>apply_options</code>
    to handle pagination of the language list
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>apply_options/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Processes pagination parameters and determines if data needs to be reloaded.
  Uses a three-tier approach for pagination values: URL parameters when user
  changes page or items per page, existing options when user resets current
  view, and module defaults when accessed without any pagination parameters.
  Takes the socket, params, and force_reset flag as arguments, and returns
  either an updated or unchanged socket.
</p>
<p>Here's what happens step by step:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Convert Parameters</strong>:
    <p>
      Uses <code>convert_params/2</code> to get pagination values from either
      URL parameters, existing options, or defaults.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Validate Options</strong>:
    <p>
      Ensures pagination values are within valid ranges using
      <code>validate_options/2</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Check If Reset Is Needed</strong>:
    <p>We reload the data if any of these are true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>force_reset = true</code> - User clicked "reset" to resort the
        list
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>valid_options != options</code> - User picked a different page or
        changed items per page
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>valid_options.page != new_options.page</code> - Page number was
        adjusted during validation. Imagine you're on penultimate page 5 and
        delete all its items. If you try to go to last page 6, validation will
        adjust back to page 5 (now the last page). Even though both options and
        valid_options say "page 5", we still need to reload to show the correct
        items for that last page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reload Data and Update Socket</strong>:
    <p>
      If any of above checks triggered a reload, fetch fresh data and update all
      our counts and options.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This function handles three main types of user interactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"change-per-page"</strong>
    <p>
      When users change how many items they want to see per page, two things
      happen: we update the socket with the new value and update the URL with
      <code>push_patch</code>. Having the correct settings in the URL means
      users can bookmark or share their preferred view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"reset-stream"</strong>
    <p>
      After adding, editing, or deleting a language, users see a flash message
      with a "reset" link. Clicking this link fires the "reset-stream" action
      that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gets fresh data by calling <code>apply_options/3</code> with
        <code>force_reset=true</code>, which ensures everything is in its proper
        sorted position
      </li>
      <li>Cleans up by removing old flash messages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"delete"</strong>
    <p>When users delete a language, we handle it gracefully in two steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, we update all our counts using <code>handle_deleted/2</code>, set
        <code>:pending_deletion=true</code>, and mark the item as deleted in the
        UI. The item stays visible (but grayed out) until users navigate away or
        refresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, we show a flash message with a reset link, encouraging users to
        refresh their view when they're ready to see the final, sorted list
        without the deleted item.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>Handles messages that come in asynchronously from two sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    From form components when the current user creates or updates a language
  </li>
  <li>From broadcasts when other users make changes</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Form Updates (Current User's Actions)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creating a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          When the form component emits a
          <code>{FormComponent, {:created, language}}</code> message, the
          LiveView invokes <code>handle_created/2</code> to update counts and
          insert the new language into the stream. A flash message with a reset
          link is then displayed, allowing the user to refresh and sort the
          list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Updating a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          Similarly, when the form component sends a
          <code>{FormComponent, {:updated, language}}</code> message,
          <code>handle_updated/2</code> is called to update the language in the
          stream. A flash message confirms the successful update to the user.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Broadcast Updates (Other Users' Actions)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Someone Creates a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          <code>{PaginatedLanguages, {:created, language}}</code> broadcast is
          received. The LiveView uses <code>handle_created/2</code> to update
          counts, add the language's ID to visible_ids (since it will be shown
          at the top of the current page), and add the language to the stream. A
          flash message with a reset link notifies the user of the new addition
          and prompts them to refresh and sort the list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Someone Updates a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          Upon receiving a
          <code>{PaginatedLanguages, {:updated, language}}</code> broadcast, we
          first check if the language.id is in socket.assigns.visible_ids. If it
          is, handle_updated/2 updates the language in the stream and a flash
          message informs the user. If not, the update is ignored since it
          doesn't affect the current page view. This optimization reduces
          unnecessary UI updates and improves performance in scenarios with many
          concurrent users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Someone Deletes a Language:</strong>
        <p>
          If a language is deleted by another user, a
          <code>{PaginatedLanguages, {:deleted, language}}</code> message is
          received. The total count is always updated to reflect the database
          state. If the deleted item was visible on the current page, the
          LiveView calls <code>handle_deleted/2</code> to mark the language as
          deleted in the stream, and shows appropriate notifications: if the
          deleted language was being edited by the current user, a flash message
          notifies them of the deletion and closes the edit modal; otherwise, a
          general flash message informs the user that the language has been
          deleted and will be removed upon navigation or refresh.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
  <code>handle_deleted/2</code>, <code>handle_created/2</code>, and
  <code>handle_updated/2</code>
</h3>
<p>
  Both <code>handle_event/3</code> (user-initiated actions) and
  <code>handle_info/2</code> (broadcasted actions from other users) utilize
  these functions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Flagging Items:</strong>
    <p>
      Each function adds a specific flag to the language
      structâ€”<code>:created</code>, <code>:updated</code>, or
      <code>:deleted</code>. These flags enable the UI to visually distinguish
      items by applying badges and colors, providing immediate feedback on their
      status.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Updating Counts:</strong>
    <p>
      They adjust various count assignments such as <code>:count_all</code>,
      <code>:count_all_summary</code>, and <code>:count_visible_rows</code>. For
      a detailed explanation of how these counts work, refer to the
      <code>init/2</code> section.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_pagination_url/2</code></strong>
    <p>
      Generates URLs for pagination by encoding query parameters. The function
      accepts options and an optional base path, combining them into a complete
      URL for navigation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_flash_message_with_reset_link/1</code></strong>
    <p>
      Creates a flash message with an embedded "reload and sort" link, providing
      users with both feedback and an action to refresh the data state.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_page_summary/4</code></strong>
    <p>
      Generates the pagination summary text (e.g., "Showing 1 - 5 of 100") by
      calculating the correct range based on current page, items per page, and
      total count.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_row_class/1</code></strong>
    <p>
      Determines the appropriate CSS class for table rows based on the language
      entry's state (created, updated, or deleted), providing visual feedback
      through different background colors and styles.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>format_percentage/2</code></strong>
    <p>
      Formats numerical values into percentage strings with configurable
      precision, using the Number.Percentage formatter for consistent display
      across the application.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>index.html.heex</h2>

<p>
  Beyond standard Phoenix LiveView markup, here are few things worth to mention:
</p>

<h4>Count Management in UI</h4>
<p>
  The template uses different count variables for different UI elements, as
  explained in the <code>init/2</code> section:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The summary text uses <code>@count_all_summary</code> to maintain accurate
    "Showing X of Y" text even when items are marked as deleted but still
    visible
  </li>
  <li>
    The pagination component uses <code>@count_all_pagination</code> to ensure
    page numbers remain stable until the user explicitly reloads or navigates
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Navigation Behavior</h4>
<p>
  The pagination component includes a hook that automatically scrolls back to
  the top of the page whenever the page number changes, providing a smoother
  navigation experience.
</p>

<h4>Stream Demonstration</h4>
<p>
  In the countrycode column, you'll notice:
  <code>&lt;dd>{Timex.now()}&lt;/dd></code>
</p>
<p>
  This timestamp is included purely for demonstration purposesâ€”it shows when
  each row was stream-inserted, helping developers understand when and how the
  stream updates. In a production application, you would typically not include
  this debugging information.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>form_component.ex</h2>

<p>
  The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.StepsLive.Paginated.FormComponent</code> adds two
  advanced features to standard Phoenix LiveView form handling: optimistic
  locking for concurrent updates and dynamic country code suggestions. Let's see
  how these work together across the component and schema:
</p>

<h3>Optimistic Locking</h3>
<p>
  When multiple users edit the same record simultaneously, we need to prevent
  one user from accidentally overwriting another's changes. Phoenix and Ecto
  provide optimistic locking to handle this. Here's how it works:
</p>

<h4>How to Implement</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add version tracking to your database table:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>add :lock_version, :integer, default: 0</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Add the field to your schema
        (LivePlayground.PaginatedLanguages.Language):</strong
      >
    </p>
    <pre><code>field :lock_version, :integer, default: 0</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add force_change before optimistic_lock:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>|> force_change(:lock_version, record.lock_version)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This forced update ensures version check happens even when the form data
      itself hasn't changed. Without it, submitting an unchanged form would
      bypass optimistic locking - if another user had modified the data in the
      meantime, you wouldn't see a conflict message and the form would
      incorrectly close as if successful.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add optimistic lock to your changeset:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>|> optimistic_lock(:lock_version)</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Configure update in your context
        (LivePlayground.PaginatedLanguages):</strong
      >
    </p>
    <pre><code>Repo.update(changeset, stale_error_field: :lock_version)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This crucial step ensures that version conflicts appear in
      <code>changeset.errors[:lock_version]</code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Include the version in your form component:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;.input field={@form[:lock_version]} type="hidden" /&gt;</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handle version conflicts in your save function:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>if changeset.errors[:lock_version] do
  # Someone else updated the record while we were editing
  latest_language = PaginatedLanguages.get_language!(language.id)
  # Show the latest version to the user
  # Let them merge their changes with the new version
end</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>
  Let's say two users, Alice and Bob, start editing the same language record:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Both load the record with <code>lock_version = 1</code></li>
  <li>
    Alice saves her changes first. The database updates the record and
    increments
    <code>lock_version</code> to 2
  </li>
  <li>
    When Bob tries to save, his form still has <code>lock_version = 1</code>
  </li>
  <li>Ecto sees the mismatch and returns a <code>:lock_version</code> error</li>
  <li>
    Our code then loads the latest version and lets Bob merge his changes with
    Alice's updates
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This approach is called "optimistic" because it assumes conflicts are rare and
  only checks for them at save time, rather than locking the record during the
  entire edit session.
</p>

<h3>Country Code Suggestions with Smart Validation</h3>
<p>
  Our form needs to both suggest valid country codes and validate the final
  input. While we could handle these as separate events, we combine them for
  better user experience. Here's why and how:
</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>
  If we validated the country code separately from suggestions, users would see
  "Code not found" errors while typing, even when valid suggestions are being
  displayed in the autocomplete list. This would be confusing and provide a poor
  user experience.
</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>
  We combine suggestion lookup and validation in the
  <code>validate</code> event:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When matches are found for autocomplete, we skip validation using
    <code>validate_countrycode_exists: false</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    When no matches exist, we enable validation using
    <code>validate_countrycode_exists: true</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    User starts typing a country code, triggering the
    <code>validate</code> event
  </li>
  <li>We search for matching codes to populate the autocomplete list</li>
  <li>
    If matches are found:
    <ul>
      <li>Skip database validation</li>
      <li>User sees suggestions without error messages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If no matches are found:
    <ul>
      <li>Perform database validation</li>
      <li>User sees "Code not found" if input is invalid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Improved Form Validation UX</h3>
<p>
  Our form handles validation in a way that prevents an overwhelming user
  experience. We've addressed a common problem with real-time validation:
</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>
  With standard Phoenix LiveView validation, the form shows error messages for
  all fields as soon as the user starts typing in <em>any</em> field - including
  required field errors for fields the user hasn't reached yet. This creates a
  poor experience where users see multiple red error messages before they've
  even had a chance to fill out the form.
</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>
  We modified the validation pipeline to separate different types of validation:
</p>

<pre><code>|> Map.update!(:errors, fn errors ->
  Enum.reject(errors, fn
    {_, {_, [validation: :required]}} -> true
    _ -> false
  end)
end)</code></pre>

<p>This approach:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Creates a changeset with all validations applied</li>
  <li>Removes only "required field" errors during typing</li>
  <li>Keeps other validation errors (like format, type, length)</li>
  <li>Sets the action to display the remaining errors</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    During form interaction, users get immediate feedback on format errors (like
    invalid email format)
  </li>
  <li>
    Required field errors are suppressed until form submission, preventing
    premature error messages
  </li>
  <li>
    When the user clicks Save, full validation occurs including required field
    checks
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The <code>Map.update!</code> function specifically modifies the
  <code>:errors</code> key in the changeset, filtering out required field errors
  while keeping all others. This surgical approach gives us precise control over
  which validation messages users see and when they see them.

<h2>paginated_languages.ex</h2>

<p>
  <code>LivePlayground.PaginatedLanguages</code> handles three key aspects of
  our application:
</p>

<p><strong>Real-time Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>broadcast/2</code> sets up broadcasts for all database changes. Note
    how create/update/delete functions end with
    <code>|> broadcast(:created)</code>, <code>|> broadcast(:updated)</code>, or
    <code>|> broadcast(:deleted)</code>. The broadcast uses
    <code>broadcast_from</code> with <code>self()</code> to ensure the
    originating process doesn't receive its own broadcast messages, preventing
    redundant updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provides <code>subscribe/0</code> function that, when called in LiveView's
    mount, enables the view to receive these broadcasts. This means when any
    connected user creates, updates, or deletes a language, all other connected
    users (except the initiator) will see these changes immediately, maintaining
    efficient real-time synchronization.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pagination</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>list_languages/1</code> implements efficient database pagination that
    combines sorting and page slicing in a single query.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Optimistic Locking</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Configures <code>Repo.update</code> with
    <code>stale_error_field: :lock_version</code>, which enables version
    conflict detection. This setting ensures that
    <code>changeset.errors[:lock_version]</code> will be set in our form
    component when concurrent update conflicts occur.
  </li>
</ul>
