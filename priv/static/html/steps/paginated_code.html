<p>
  The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.StepsLive.Paginated.Index</code> module is a
  Phoenix LiveView that manages a paginated list of languages. It incorporates
  real-time updates, pagination controls, and concurrency.
</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>
  <strong>Why Two Mount Functions?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The approach is quite practical: when someone just visits
    <code>/steps/paginated</code>, we can simply use default values (page 1,
    standard items per page) without any extra checks. However, when the URL
    contains parameters like
    <code>/steps/paginated?page=999&per_page=999</code>—whether typed manually
    or manipulated—we need to validate these numbers before showing any data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using two separate mount functions with pattern matching makes this
    distinction clean and efficient.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>First <code>mount/3</code> Function (With Parameters)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the socket is connected, we subscribe to language updates using
    <code>Languages2.subscribe()</code>. We need this to display messages when
    other connected users add, edit, or delete languages. For example, if
    another user adds a new language, you'll see a notification like "A new
    language was added by another user" and the item will appear in your list.
  </li>
  <li>
    We first convert page and per_page parameters to integers using
    <code>to_integer/2</code>, which safely handles both integer and string
    inputs, defaulting to specified values if parsing fails.
  </li>
  <li>
    We then validate these options using <code>validate_options/2</code>. If the
    validated options differ from the original options, we redirect using
    <code>push_navigate</code>. This ensures that the URL accurately reflects
    the validated state.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Second <code>mount/3</code> Function (Without Parameters)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We set default values for
    <code>page</code> and <code>per_page</code>.
  </li>
  <li>We call the <code>init/2</code> function with these default options.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>validate_options/2</code></h3>
<p>
  Ensures that <code>page</code> and <code>per_page</code> are within acceptable
  ranges.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It calls <code>get_existing_page/3</code>, which uses
    <code>ceil_div/2</code> to calculate the maximum number of pages based on
    the total item count and the <code>per_page</code> value. For example, if
    there are 45 items and <code>per_page</code> is set to 10,
    <code>ceil_div</code> computes that there should be 5 pages. If someone
    types page 6 in the URL (like <code>/steps/paginated?page=6</code>),
    <code>get_existing_page</code> will automatically adjust it to page 5, since
    that's the last available page.
  </li>
  <li>
    If <code>per_page</code> is not one of the allowed options, it defaults to
    <code>@per_page</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>init/2</code></h3>
<p>Handles all the initial setup that both mount functions need.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>:options</code></strong
      >: Stores the current pagination options (<code>page</code> and
      <code>per_page</code>).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We maintain three different count variables, each serving a specific
      purpose in our UI:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>:count_all</code> - The real database count</li>
      <li>
        <code>:count_all_summary</code> - What users see in the "Showing X of Y"
        text
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>:count_all_pagination</code> - Used for calculating page numbers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's see why we need all three:</p>
    <p>
      <code>:count_all</code> serves as the definitive count of all language
      items present in the database. It reflects the true state of the data at
      any given moment. Whenever a language is added or deleted,
      <code>:count_all</code> is immediately updated to mirror these changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      While <code>:count_all</code> provides the actual total count,
      <code>:count_all_summary</code> is specifically used for the summary
      display presented to the user, such as "Showing 1 - 5 of 100." The key
      reason for keeping <code>:count_all_summary</code> separate from
      <code>:count_all</code> lies in handling deletions gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>When a user deletes an item:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><code>:count_all</code></strong> decreases immediately to
        reflect the removal from the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>:count_all_summary</code></strong> remains unchanged
        because the deleted item is still visible on the current page, marked
        appropriately (e.g., with a badge, gray background, and strikethrough).
        This ensures that the summary accurately represents what the user sees.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <code>:count_all_pagination</code> is essential for keeping the pagination
      controls consistent in the application. Unlike
      <code>:count_all_summary</code>, which can temporarily differ from
      <code>:count_all</code> when items are being deleted,
      <code>:count_all_pagination</code> ensures that the number of pages
      remains stable and only updates when necessary—such as when the user
      resorts the list, reloads, or navigates away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <code>:count_all_summary</code> directly for pagination would lead
      to inconsistencies. Consider the following scenario:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are 100 items distributed over 5 pages (20 items per page).</li>
      <li>
        After adding an item:
        <ul>
          <li><code>:count_all</code> increases to 101.</li>
          <li>
            <code>:count_all_summary</code> also increases to 101, updating the
            summary to display "Showing 1 - 6 of 101."
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>:count_all_pagination</code> remains at 100 to prevent the
            immediate appearance of a 6th page.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is because the new item fits into the existing pages by temporarily
      displaying 21 items on the current page (1-21), keeping all items within
      the original 5 pages. The 6th page only appears when the user resorts the
      list or navigates away. At that point,
      <code>:count_all_pagination</code> is updated to reflect the new total
      count of 101, allowing the pagination to adjust appropriately.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><code>:count_visible_rows</code></strong> represents the number of
      items currently visible to the user on the page. This value can exceed the
      <code>per_page</code> limit temporarily when new items are added to the
      current view. For example, if <code>per_page</code> is set to 10 and a new
      item is added, <code>:count_visible_rows</code> becomes 11 to accommodate
      the newly added item. This ensures that the user sees the addition
      immediately without needing to resort or navigate away. Once the user
      resorts the list or moves to another page,
      <code>:count_visible_rows</code> returns to align with the
      <code>per_page</code> value, ensuring consistency in the pagination view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <code>:pending_deletion</code> flag is set to <code>true</code> when
      items are marked as deleted in the UI but have already been removed from
      the database. When this flag is true, the summary section is grayed out to
      indicate that the displayed counts may not accurately reflect the current
      data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Stream Initialization</strong>: We use <code>stream/3</code> to
      set up the initial list of languages. We do this in
      <code>init/2</code> (which is called by <code>mount/3</code>) rather than
      in <code>handle_params/3</code>. This ensures the stream is established
      just once when the LiveView mounts, not every time URL parameters change,
      avoiding unnecessary reloads.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><code>handle_params/3</code></h3>
<p>
  Manages updates to URL parameters and handles LiveView actions such as
  navigating between listing, editing, or creating new languages.
</p>
<p>Specifically, it performs two main tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>apply_action/3</code> function sets the appropriate state and data
    for listing, editing, or creating languages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>apply_options/4</code> function updates pagination options and
    reloads the language list when necessary. Refer to the explanation below for
    more details.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>apply_action/3</code></h3>
<p>
  This function configures the socket based on the current LiveView action.
  Depending on whether the user is viewing the index, editing a language, or
  creating a new one, this function assigns the appropriate state and data to
  the socket. For instance, if the user initiates an edit action,
  <code>apply_action/3</code> sets up the socket with the specific language data
  to be edited.
</p>
<h3><code>apply_options/4</code></h3>
<p>
  Handles pagination updates. It has two versions, separated by pattern
  matching:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Index Action (<code>:index</code>)</strong>:
    <p>
      For the main listing page, where we need pagination. This version handles
      all the parameter updates and data reloading.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Other Actions</strong>:
    <p>
      For <code>:edit</code> or <code>:new</code> modals, where we don't need
      pagination. This version simply returns the socket unchanged.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This pattern matching approach means we only do pagination work when we're
  actually handling the paginated list.
</p>

<p>For the index version, here's what happens step by step:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Extract Options and Parameters</strong>:
    <p>
      Get <code>per_page</code> and <code>page</code> from either the URL
      parameters or fall back to current values.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Convert and Validate Parameters</strong>:
    <p>
      Make sure we have valid numbers for our pagination. First convert strings
      to integers, then check if they're in acceptable ranges.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Check If Reload Is Needed</strong>:
    <p>We reload the data if any of these are true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>reset_stream = true</code> - User clicked "reset" to resort the
        list
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>valid_options != options</code> - User picked a different page or
        changed items per page
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>valid_options.page != page</code> - Page number was adjusted.
        Imagine you're on page 5 and delete all its items. If you try to go to
        page 6, we'll adjust back to page 5 (now the last page). Even though
        both old and new options say "page 5", we still need to reload to show
        the correct items for that last page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reload Data and Update Socket</strong>:
    <p>
      If any of above checks triggered a reload, fetch fresh data and update all
      our counts and options.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Update URL If Needed</strong>:
    <p>
      If the page number changed (like in our page 5 example), update the URL
      using <code>push_patch</code>. This updates the URL without a full page
      reload, so users can bookmark or share the correct page.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Return Socket</strong>:
    <p>
      If nothing needed reloading, return the socket as-is. Otherwise, return
      the updated socket with fresh data.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>This function handles three main types of user interactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"change-per-page"</strong>
    <p>
      When users change how many items they want to see per page, two things
      happen: we update the socket with the new value and update the URL with
      <code>push_patch</code>. Having the correct settings in the URL means
      users can bookmark or share their preferred view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"reset-stream"</strong>
    <p>
      After adding, editing, or deleting a language, users see a flash message
      with a "reset" link. Clicking this link fires the "reset-stream" action
      that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gets fresh data by calling <code>apply_options/4</code> with
        <code>reset_stream=true</code>, which ensures everything is in its
        proper sorted position
      </li>
      <li>Cleans up by removing old flash messages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"delete"</strong>
    <p>When users delete a language, we handle it gracefully in two steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, we update all our counts using <code>handle_deleted/2</code>, set
        <code>:pending_deletion=true</code>, and mark the item as deleted in the
        UI. The item stays visible (but grayed out) until users navigate away or
        refresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, we show a flash message with a reset link, encouraging users to
        refresh their view when they're ready to see the final, sorted list
        without the deleted item.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_info/2</code></h3>
<p>Handles messages that come in asynchronously from two sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    From form components when the current user creates or updates a language
  </li>
  <li>From broadcasts when other users make changes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Form Updates (Current User's Actions)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Creating a Language:</strong>
    <p>
      When the form component emits a
      <code>{FormComponent, {:created, language}}</code> message, the LiveView
      invokes <code>handle_created/2</code> to update counts and insert the new
      language into the stream. A flash message with a reset link is then
      displayed, allowing the user to refresh and sort the list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Updating a Language:</strong>
    <p>
      Similarly, when the form component sends a
      <code>{FormComponent, {:updated, language}}</code> message,
      <code>handle_updated/2</code> is called to update the language in the
      stream. A flash message confirms the successful update to the user.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Broadcast Updates (Other Users' Actions)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Someone Creates a Language:</strong>
    <p>
      <code>{Languages2, {:created, language}}</code> broadcast is received. The
      LiveView uses <code>handle_created/2</code> to update counts and add the
      new language to the stream. A flash message with a reset link notifies the
      user of the new addition and prompts them to refresh and sort the list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Someone Updates a Language:</strong>
    <p>
      Upon receiving a
      <code>{Languages2, {:updated, language}}</code> broadcast,
      <code>handle_updated/2</code> updates the language in the stream. A flash
      message informs the user that a language was updated by another user.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Someone Deletes a Language:</strong>
    <p>
      If a language is deleted by another user, a
      <code>{Languages2, {:deleted, language}}</code> message is received. The
      LiveView calls <code>handle_deleted/2</code> to update counts and mark the
      language as deleted in the stream. If the deleted language was being
      edited by the current user, a flash message notifies them of the deletion
      and closes the edit modal. Otherwise, a general flash message informs the
      user that the language has been deleted and will be removed upon
      navigation or refresh.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  <code>handle_deleted/2</code>, <code>handle_created/2</code>, and
  <code>handle_updated/2</code>
</h3>
<p>
  Both <code>handle_event/3</code> (user-initiated actions) and
  <code>handle_info/2</code> (broadcasted actions from other users) utilize
  these functions.
</p>
<h4>Core Concepts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Flagging Items:</strong>
    <p>
      Each function adds a specific flag to the language
      struct—<code>:created</code>, <code>:updated</code>, or
      <code>:deleted</code>. These flags enable the UI to visually distinguish
      items by applying badges and colors, providing immediate feedback on their
      status.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Updating Counts:</strong>
    <p>
      They adjust various count assignments such as <code>:count_all</code>,
      <code>:count_all_summary</code>, and <code>:count_all_pagination</code>.
      These counts ensure that summaries and pagination controls accurately
      reflect the current state of the data. For a detailed explanation of how
      these counts work, refer to the <code>init/2</code> section.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Helper Functions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_pagination_url/2</code></strong>
    <p>
      Generates URLs for accessing the current page, used when opening or
      closing modals, navigating back, and other pagination-related actions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>get_page_summary/4</code></strong>
    <p>
      Creates the summary text displayed above the data table, such as "Showing
      1 - 5 of 100."
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>format_percentage/2</code></strong>
    <p>
      Formats numerical values into percentage strings with specified precision.
      Applied within table cells and detailed views to present percentage data
      clearly.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
