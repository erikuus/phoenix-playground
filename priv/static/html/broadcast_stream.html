<p>The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.RecipesLive.BroadcastStream</code> module uses LiveView's streaming capabilities along with Phoenix PubSub to manage and update city data in real-time for the "EST" region. It integrates optimistic locking to prevent data conflicts during concurrent updates. This setup not only minimizes server load by avoiding full page reloads but also enhances user experience by ensuring data consistency and immediate feedback in response to updates from other users.</p>
<h3><code>mount/3</code></h3>
<p>Sets up the initial environment by subscribing to updates and initializing a stream of city data for "EST". This ensures that the server load is minimized as only the data changes are transmitted in real-time, rather than reloading the entire dataset.</p>
<h3><code>terminate/2</code></h3>
<p>Properly unsubscribes from the PubSub topic when the LiveView session ends. This step is crucial for freeing up system resources and preventing memory leaks, ensuring the application's performance remains optimal.</p>
<h3><code>handle_params/2</code> and <code>apply_action/2</code></h3>
<p>Manages navigation and interaction within the LiveView based on incoming parameters, updating the UI accordingly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Index Action</strong>: Prepares the interface for adding a new city.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Action</strong>: Retrieves an existing city for editing. If the city is not found, an error message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the main view.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>render/1</code></h3>
<p>Renders an interactive form and table:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Form Interaction</strong>: Supports both creation and editing of city details, adjusting dynamically based on user actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Table Display</strong>: Streams current city data, incorporating real-time updates and deletions directly within the UI. Each table entry includes a timestamp, showing when the city was last updated or inserted into the stream.</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>handle_event/3</code></h3>
<p>Handles user actions such as saving edits, validating input, or deleting entries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Save</strong>: Uses the <code>save_city/3</code> helper to either add a new city or update an existing one. This function checks for version conflicts using optimistic locking, broadcasts successful updates, and handles any errors gracefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Removes a city and updates all client views immediately, maintaining data consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Validate</strong>: Provides real-time validation feedback during form editing, helping users correct entries before submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>LivePlaygroundWeb.RecipesLive.BroadcastStream</code> module is an effective solution for managing large data collections in real-time applications, showcasing how to integrate LiveView with PubSub for data consistency and how optimistic locking can be used to handle concurrent data updates securely. This approach minimizes server load and enhances user experience by ensuring that data interactions are handled efficiently and reliably.</p>
