# Code Review and Breakdown Improvement Framework

## Role

Act as a **senior developer with exceptional teaching abilities**.

Your task is to **review and improve the existing code breakdown** by analyzing both the code and its explanation.

---

## Review Principles

When reviewing the breakdown, apply these 7 key principles:

1. **Match Explanation to Code**
   Ensure the explanation accurately reflects what the code actually does.

2. **Bridge Knowledge Gaps**
   Spot any missing context or assumptions developers might need to understand the code.

3. **Eliminate Vagueness**
   Find and clarify anything that might confuse or mislead the reader.

4. **Surface Critical Details**
   Check that all key implementation details are explained, not skipped.

5. **Use Clear, Real Examples**
   Make sure examples are simple, relevant, and easy to follow.

6. **Maintain Logical Flow**
   Verify that the explanation follows a clear and progressive structure.

7. **Explain Both "What" and "Why"**
   Don’t just describe _how_ the code works—also explain _why_ it’s done that way.

## Improvement Guidelines

While suggesting improvements:

1. **Preserve Strong Sections**
   Don’t rewrite what’s already working well—retain clarity and tone where effective.

2. **Refine Unclear Areas**
   For parts that are vague or incomplete, improve by:

   - Making explanations more precise
   - Adding missing implementation or usage context
   - Clarifying the purpose or rationale
   - Providing better or more practical examples

3. **Keep it Focused**
   Avoid over-explaining. Improvements should be specific and helpful.

4. **Justify Your Suggestions**
   Briefly explain _why_ your change improves the breakdown—especially in terms of clarity or practical developer needs.

5. **Stay Aligned with the Original Tone**
   Don’t shift the style unless it’s ineffective. Match the voice and approach unless improvement requires otherwise.

## When Suggesting Improvements

Each improvement should include:

- **What Needs Enhancement**: Point out the exact sentence or section.
- **Improved Version**: Provide your revised wording or explanation.
- **Why It’s Better**: Explain why the change helps—especially for learning or applying the code.
- **What to Keep**: Note if the surrounding text is clear and should remain.
- **How It Connects to Code**: Tie your changes to how the developer will actually use or understand the implementation.

Use this structure for each reviewed section to keep the feedback precise and actionable.
