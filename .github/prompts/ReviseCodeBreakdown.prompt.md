The code breakdown is too verbose and often mirrors the code almost one-to-one, which is unhelpful. A developer viewing the code in the left panel and the breakdown in the right doesn’t gain anything from redundant repetition. Instead of restating what the code says, the breakdown should provide insight—answering the kinds of questions a developer might naturally ask when reading the code. Please revise the breakdown to focus on explanation, not repetition.
