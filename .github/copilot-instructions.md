This file defines the coding conventions that MUST be followed when writing or modifying LiveView code. These conventions ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase.

## Core Principles

### The Stepdown Rule

ALWAYS organize functions in a top-down manner, where each function is followed by the functions it calls. This rule is MANDATORY because it:

- Makes code breakdowns easy to read top-to-bottom
- Creates a natural flow through the code
- Helps maintain clear dependencies between functions

### Function Extraction Guidelines

You MUST follow these guidelines when deciding whether to extract code into separate functions:

**DO NOT extract functions when:**

- The logic is only used once (no reusability benefit)
- The code is few lines and conceptually part of the main operation
- It would create unnecessary function jumping that hurts readability
- The extracted function would just be a simple wrapper

**DO extract functions when:**

- Logic is reused across multiple events or functions
- Complex algorithms span 10+ lines with intricate logic
- Clear conceptual boundaries exist (like data transformation utilities)
- Helper utilities serve multiple purposes

**Example of appropriate inline code:**

```elixir
case Cities.create_city_broadcast(params) do
  {:ok, city} ->
    acc
    |> stream_delete(:tabular_inputs, %{id: id})
    |> stream_insert(:cities, city, at: 0)
    |> update(:tabular_input_ids, &List.delete(&1, id))
    |> put_flash(:info, "City created successfully.")

  {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{} = changeset} ->
    tabular_input = %{id: id, form: to_form(changeset)}
    stream_insert(acc, :tabular_inputs, tabular_input)
end
```

This code should NOT be extracted because the success/error handling is conceptually part of the save operation and each branch is short and readable.

### Template Component Extraction Guidelines

You MUST follow these guidelines when deciding whether to extract template components:

**DO NOT extract template components when:**

- The component is only used in one place (no reusability benefit)
- The component is tightly coupled to the parent's assigns
- The extracted part is conceptually part of the main template
- Editor features like code folding provide sufficient organization

**DO extract template components when:**

- The component is reused across multiple templates
- The component represents a complex, self-contained widget
- Clear conceptual boundaries exist (like shared navigation components)
- The component has its own logic that benefits from isolation

**Example of appropriate inline template code:**

```heex
def render(assigns) do
  ~H"""
  <.header>...</.header>           <!-- Page header -->
  <form phx-submit="save">...</form>  <!-- Tabular input form -->
  <.table>...</.table>             <!-- Results table -->
  <div class="mt-10">...</div>     <!-- Code examples -->
  """
end
```

This template structure should NOT be extracted into components because each section is conceptually part of the main page flow and is only used once. Editor code folding provides sufficient organization for managing large templates.

## Module Structure

### Function Ordering Convention

You MUST order functions in LiveView modules as follows:

1. Documentation and Imports at the top

   - Module documentation
   - All imports and aliases

2. `mount/3` function

   - Place ALL helpers it uses directly after it
   - NO other functions should come between mount and its helpers

3. `handle_params/3` function

   - Place ALL helpers it uses directly after it
   - For helpers shared with `mount`, place after the highest-level function that uses them
   - For helpers shared between other helpers, place after the highest-level function that uses them

4. `render/1` function (if present)

   - MUST come after mount/handle_params and before event handlers
   - Functional components called by `render/1` MUST be placed immediately after `render/1` following the stepdown rule

5. `handle_event/3` function

6. `handle_info/2` function

7. Helper functions for `render`, `handle_event`, and `handle_info`
   - MUST be placed at the end
   - Group helpers with their main function
   - NOTE: This applies only to helper functions, NOT functional components. Functional components follow the stepdown rule and are placed immediately after their caller.

## State Management

### Ordering `assign` and `stream` Calls

You MUST update core UI-related state BEFORE handling data streams. This rule exists because:

- Ensures assigned values are up-to-date before stream updates
- Prevents race conditions in state updates

CORRECT:

```elixir
# First update UI state, then handle streams
socket
|> assign(:options, options)
|> stream(:data, items, reset: true)
```

INCORRECT:

```elixir
# Don't handle streams before UI state
socket
|> stream(:data, items, reset: true)
|> assign(:options, options)
```

### Ordering `put_flash` and `stream` Calls

Flash messages (`put_flash`) are considered UI feedback operations and MUST come AFTER stream operations, not before. This is because:

- Flash messages provide feedback about the result of data operations
- Stream operations modify the actual data being displayed
- The logical flow is: update data â†’ provide feedback about the update

CORRECT:

```elixir
# First handle stream, then provide feedback
socket
|> stream_insert(:cities, city)
|> put_flash(:info, "City successfully updated.")
```

INCORRECT:

```elixir
# Don't provide feedback before handling stream
socket
|> put_flash(:info, "City successfully updated.")
|> stream_insert(:cities, city)
```

### Code Style for State Updates

1. For multiple variables or complex logic, you MUST use expanded form:

```elixir
# DO use expanded form for complex operations
data = fetch_data(params)
count = count_items(data)

socket =
  socket
  |> assign(:count, count)
  |> assign(:data, data)
```

2. For single variable or straightforward logic, you MUST use concise form:

```elixir
# DO use concise form for simple operations
socket
|> assign(:data, fetch_data(params))
```

## Function Naming

### Helper Function Categories

1. State-Manipulating Functions (returning `socket`)

   - MUST use action-oriented verbs
   - DO use: `init`, `apply_options`, `apply_action`
   - DON'T use: `options`, `data`, `setup`

2. Data Transformation Functions (modifying variables or data structures)

   - MUST use verbs indicating the transformation
   - DO use: `update_params`, `to_integer`
   - DON'T use: `params`, `integer`

3. Value-Retrieving Functions
   - MUST use the `get_` prefix
   - DO use: `get_existing_page`, `get_pagination_url`
   - DON'T use: `existing_page`, `pagination_url`

## Message Handling

### Phoenix PubSub Message Structure

You MUST structure ALL broadcasted messages as a tuple containing:

1. The module name (`__MODULE__`)
2. A tuple of event and resource

CORRECT:

```elixir
# DO structure messages this way
{__MODULE__, {event, resource}}
```

INCORRECT:

```elixir
# DON'T structure messages these ways
{event, resource}  # Missing module name
{__MODULE__, event, resource}  # Wrong tuple structure
```

## Error Handling

### Phoenix Context Functions with !

When using Phoenix context functions that end with ! (like Cities.get_city!), you MUST NOT add additional error handling for expected failure cases.

Functions ending with ! are designed to:

Raise exceptions for expected error cases (like "not found")
Let Phoenix automatically handle these exceptions
Return appropriate HTTP responses (like 404) without additional code

CORRECT:

```elixir
# DO let Phoenix handle the exception
defp apply_action(%{"id" => id}, :edit, socket) do
  city = Cities.get_city!(id)  # Phoenix handles the 404 if not found

  socket
  |> assign(:city, city)
  |> assign(:form, get_city_form(city))
end
```

INCORRECT:

```elixir
# DON'T add unnecessary error handling
defp apply_action(%{"id" => id}, :edit, socket) do
  case Cities.get_city(id) do
    {:ok, city} ->
      socket
      |> assign(:city, city)
      |> assign(:form, get_city_form(city))

    {:error, :not_found} ->
      socket
      |> put_flash(:error, "City not found.")
      |> push_patch(to: ~p"/cities")
  end
end
```

Rule: If Phoenix's default error handling (like returning a 404 page) is sufficient, use the ! version and let Phoenix handle it automatically.
