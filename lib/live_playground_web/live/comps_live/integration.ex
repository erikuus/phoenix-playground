        <h3>CoreComponents</h3>
        <p>
          In a new Phoenix application, you will find a CoreComponents module inside the components folder.
          This module is a great example of defining function components to be reused throughout your application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CoreComponents also play an important role in Phoenix code generators, as the code generators assume those
          components are available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: The CoreComponents included in this playground have been slightly modified from the original source to
          better fit the specific needs and examples demonstrated here.

        <h3>MoreComponents</h3>
        <p>
          The MoreComponents are a bespoke suite that you'll discover within this playground. These are housed in a
          separate module crafted to complement the CoreComponents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MoreComponents suite comprises a range of widgets and tools that can be particularly valuable when you're
          looking to add advanced features or custom user interface elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to import MoreComponents in your <code>web.ex</code> file to make them readily available for your
          LiveView applications, just as you would with CoreComponents.
